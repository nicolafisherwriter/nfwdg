Hi Dear Friends,

Today the angels remind us to appreciate all the goodness in life – especially the miracle of our senses. While some traditions teach you to escape the senses, the angels see value in both detaching and enjoying them!

They've taught me that when you learn to appreciate and enjoy this beautiful vehicle we've been blessed with, your vibe naturally rises, so you can more easily weather the more "serious" challenges of human life!

Have a blissful week!  
♥ Ann

###### Message from the Angels

My dear friends, we love you so very much,  

Take a breath and as you exhale, relax. Take another one. Exhale. Relax even more deeply. With each exhale release your cares to the universe. All is well at this moment. You are sitting here and now, connecting with angels, and open to receiving our love. Right here, right now, breathe. Sit quietly for a few moments and imagine streams of light from our hands pouring into your hearts. Imagine your heart is open, like a flower is to the sunshine, drinking in this light. As you breathe and take in this light through your heart, imagine it filling your body, nurturing you, enlivening your cells, and loving you from the inside out. Stay in this space as long as you like.

There are a lot of arguments going on in your world right now. There are a lot of tempers running high. There are also a lot of people quietly doing good, quietly loving one another, quietly cleaning up your mother earth, quietly helping the children, the elderly, and the ones in need. There are people praying every day for humanity, for political leaders, and for the planet. There are people helping animals, people creating crafts, people baking with love. or working on behalf of one another. There are people listening and advising, people meditating, people praying, and so, so many people quietly going about their lives as kindly as they can.

Your world is inherently good. There are so many acts of love performed in the space of a single breath or a single heartbeat on your planet that you will never see. Most of them, you will never hear on your news or read about on your internet. Even in your own lives, on a given day, there are countless moments of love and goodness and things to appreciate.

Your own body is a living, breathing miracle. Each breath is a multitude of miraculous coordination. Each heartbeat is a symphony of chemistry and electricity, coordinated in ways that are beyond comprehension. Your life is so beautiful dear ones. Give thanks for it. Appreciate the unique beauty of being in the human form.

Your world offers immense beauty. Think for a moment, about a place that you find incredibly beautiful. Imagine yourself there. Immerse yourself in the memory or fantasy of its beauty. Imagine the interplay of light, color, and texture. Feel the wonderful feelings that come from remembering this special place. Perhaps you've got a spot in your own home that you find beautiful. Take time to revel in it and appreciate it.

Your world offers beautiful fragrances. What are some of your own? Do you like the smell of morning coffee? The scent of a rose? The freshness of your soap or shampoo? Is a newly cut orange enough to send you into bliss? Do you love the pines after a rain or the smell of cedar? Dinner on the grill? Think of a fragrance you enjoy, and for a moment imagine inhaling it deeply and feeling the absolute, miraculous bliss that comes with knowing your body is experiencing a veritable symphony of reactions to produce this simple pleasure!  

You have beautiful sounds in your experience. There is music that elevates your spirit, the hum of the bees, the song of the birds, the gentle breezes, the babbling brooks, the roar of the oceans, and even the beat of a lover's heart. Think of a sound you love right now or a piece of music. When you are able, listen to it. Allow yourself to feel your heart expand and your soul fill with joy as this marvelous vehicle called your body interprets frequencies in such an amazing and delightful manner.

You have tastes... glorious, amazing flavors on your planet! You have foods you absolutely enjoy! Think of some of them now. Recall a favorite meal or a favorite snack. Once again ponder the miracle of chemicals turning to signals to the brain that creates the delicious experience of this meal.

And touch! Dear friends how sublime a gift is physical touch! Give yourself a hug right now, or stroke your own hands. Feel the subtle sensations and how they ripple throughout your whole being. Recall the feel of your favorite blanket or pillow, the fur on your dog or kitty cat, the texture of the grass under your feet, or a smooth stone. Again, can you fathom the electrical and chemical symphony that must take place to give you these sensations?

You are living with miracles on a daily basis! Your life in this body is miraculous. While you have difficult news on your planet, there is good news going on right here and now in your own body, in your own life, in your own little corner of the world. Seek that. See that. Revel in that. Claim that.

Your existence was never meant to be a dance of adversity but rather a dance of wonder, splendor, sensation, immesion in Divine creation, and a glorious experience of the greater Self in the diversity of its forms. In plain terms dear one you are manifestations of the Divine having a human experience, not meant to suffer, but to revel in the buffet of experiences physical life grants you.

_You were not intended to be fearful of death but rather to immerse yourself in life. You never intended to agree – or argue – with one another, but rather to agree with the Divine inspirations from within._

You, dear ones, are lights in this world. Don't let the viewpoints of those yelling the loudest convince you that humanity is bad, that your world is ending, that your country is going to self-destruct, or that your Mother Earth is doomed.

Humanity is inherently good. Misdeeds result from pain or misunderstanding. Your world is not ending. Your countries are not going to self-destruct. Your Mother Earth is rejuvenating herself. Best of all you are living miracles, each with access to experiences that are simply unparalleled in their capacity for joy. This week, vow not to take your senses for granted. Appreciate your tastes, textures, smells, sounds, and sights. If you are missing one sense, enjoy the others even more.

It is in your appreciation of the so-called simple miracles starting with your own body and your own lives – that you begin to see the light, the love, the goodness, and the _truth_ of your being everywhere you look.

As we've said many times, your world is going through a rebirthing, and birth is a messy process. Nonetheless, even a mother in labor can appreciate the fragrance of an essential oil, a tender hand that holds her own, the gentle music or song of birds playing in the background, the taste of a cool glass of water, and a beautiful blanket held around her shoulders.

Right here, right now, dear friends, love abounds. See it. Seek it. Notice it. Appreciate it, and then no matter what your external world is doing you will begin to see the goodness and the beauty that has been there, hiding in plain sight all along.

God Bless You! We love you so very much.

###### Message from Ann...

Hi Everyone,  

The angels' last sentence about "seeing the goodness and the beauty that has been there, hiding in plain sight all along" reminds me of an incident with my cucumber plant last week. For some time I've been talking to it and asking it to make me cucumbers since I love their fresh crunch and cool flavor. Every day I'd go tickle the flowers with a paintbrush in case the bees weren't so busy, and each day I'd look for cucumbers. None were growing... or so I thought!

Then one day I noticed a yellow burst of color in the middle of the bush. To my utter surprise, there was a gigantic, overripe, yellow cucumber staring back at me. And then another! They were a little bitter but with a good ginger, garlic Asian dressing, absolutely delicious. I went out again the following week. Still no cukes. Then again one day I saw another giant, overripe, yellow one again. How was I missing these? I sat in front of that bush and said, "Can you let me know when the cukes are perfectly ripe, rather than waiting to show yourselves when you're overripe?" In my mind, I heard a reply, "Over here..." I followed the energy to find a perfectly ripe cucumber hanging there in plain sight.

_It is easy miss our miracles when they're right in front of us!_

I know many spiritual traditions teach us that we should forgo the senses to get in touch with the spirit. That always puzzled me. Why were we given these glorious bodies if not to enjoy them? The angels explained that for many in past spiritual traditions the senses were a distraction from receiving guidance and having inner spiritual experiences. You can't go within easily if you are focused on enjoying your next meal or your next romp in the hay! And you can't meditate as easily with music blaring, or your eyes open. When you focus on the outer world, it is much more challenging to tune into a better reality in the inner world.

Interestingly enough, however, if you are intensely present with a sensory experience, appreciative, grateful, and marveling at the miracle, you tend to go beyond the sensory joy and transcend the physical into a sublime experience of connection with something higher.

It is not the senses that are guilty for our disconnection but rather how we use them. We can seek sensory stimulation to escape reality, never being fully present or appreciative, but only wanting the next completely unfulfilling "high," or we can immerse ourselves in a sensory experience with reverence, appreciation, and an awareness of the miraculous love that makes it possible, thus turning an ordinary moment into an extraordinary meditation on them many forms of miraculous life.

I'll share an example from my own reality. In my twenties, I had a very high-stress job. I also had a weakness for Doritos. After a stressful day and after a good dinner; after doing what I needed around the house, I'd grab the Doritoes and begin the "mindless munchies."

One, two, three... Ignore the flavor while watching TV!

Four, five, six, seven, run around the house and pick up the messes.

Eight, nine, ten, and more. I forgot what I was eating for!

Munch, munch, munch – with little thought of appreciation – only lusty focus on the next sensation!

Seriously, it was not only not fulfilling, it was fattening and maddening. I never felt better, only full, uncomfortable, and wanting more. I'd grab a glass of chocolate milk and chase it down. It was a wonder I maintained my health and figure at all.

Years later when I wanted to become more mindful, the angels told me to get a big bag of Doritos. "Seriously?" I asked. "Yes." "Ok, what do I do?" I inquired further. "Eat one consciously," they told me. I remember thinking, "What? How?" Taste it. Eat it slowly. Savor it. Appreciate the many flavors within in. "Ok," That sounded fun. I licked the flavoring off the chip and really tasted it for the first time. Tomatoes, salt, spices, herbs. Yum. I slowly let the chips melt in my mouth. Corn, good stuff. I liked the experience. It actually felt fulfilling.

"Try again," the angels said. That was one of those days I really loved my angels!! I did it again. This time the taste felt a little strong, twangy to me, but still good. By the third chip, the craving was gone. It no longer tasted so awesome. I was enthralled. I started tasting and savoring everything, rather than inhaling my food. I started to enjoy food in a whole new way. I learned to listen to what my body was telling me about it. My body told me when it had enough of something because, eaten slowly and mindfully, it tasted good or not! It was revelatory to know that my body could actually help me understand its needs! I started to take pleasure in the quality of my food vs. the volume!

Around this time I discovered a book by a decorator that opened my eyes to a whole new way of embracing simple pleasures in life. (_Daring to be Yourself_, by Alexandra Stoddard). While many of its gentle suggestions might be considered old-fashioned by today's standards, the message intrigued me. Do you like your soap? Your file folders? Your everyday instruments? Are they pleasing to the senses, beautiful, and functional? It was the same message the angels had been trying to share with me.

I started to "upgrade" my life and I don't mean by spending more. I just was a little more careful to makes sure my everyday objects were pleasing. I sniffed soaps till I found some I liked. I painted ugly objects on my desk. I covered my old ugly file folders with leftover wrapping paper and made them pretty. It was all done on a budget because I had other expenses, but I learned to appreciate and take pleasure in beautifying the little things in life.

I know that not all these ideas are for everyone, but the moral of the stories is simple. We were given these amazing senses... why not add to the value of our life experience by appreciating them?

I now listen to beautiful music on a regular basis. I grow and cook foods that have flavors I love and I do savor them. I got rid of uncomfy clothes and keep only the ones with textures I like. I have fragrances I like around the home – candles, aromatherapy, or even more down to nature - simmering pots with orange, rosemary, and cinnamon, or some other combination of fragrant fruits and herbs. Life is meant to be lived through our senses, and while I have a rich and real inner life, I delight in the human experience as well. Both can be meditations. Whether I go within and quiet my mind, or sit fully present while enjoying some delightful sensory experience, I see the Divine, feel the Divine, taste the Divine, hear the Divine, and smell the fragrance of the Divine.

_In one very humorous way that the angels put it to me, "Ann, it's all One. Have some fun!" I love that._

_Here are a few pointers on how to appreciate the miracle of your physical experience._

**1\. Explore one sense a day  
**  
For five days, pick a sense a day – sight, sound, taste, touch, or smell. If one of your senses doesn't work or is compromised, just use one of the others. Make an effort to really appreciate your "sense of the day."

If you pick sight, look for beauty, and harmony, order, color, and things to appreciate. If you pick sound, listen to beautiful music or nature, and see how deeply you can hear the layers of sound. For taste, try your favorite foods or new foods, and really allow them to linger on your tongue. See if you can sense even more subtle nuances in flavor. You get the idea.

Explore the miracle of the sense. See if you can deepen your awareness of it. Appreciate it all day long. By the end of the day, you will have experienced and appreciated so much your vibration will naturally be higher and you will feel more grateful for life.

**2\. Give yourself or your surroundings a "sensory upgrade"**

This does not have to cost money. You can forage around your own home and find ways to make something you use more beautiful. You can paint something ugly. You can move things around into a more pleasing arrangement or create more order. You can get out the music you love, burn the candles that have been sitting in the closet, use the lotions you were gifted, cook something good for yourself or pull out a soft blanket and put it where you can enjoy it more. Just choose something that doesn't please your senses and give it an upgrade.

Appreciate your "upgrade" daily. Give thanks for it. Congratulate yourself on self-love. Appreciation is, after all, one of life's highest vibrations and always pulls more abundance and goodness into your life!

**3\.** Enjoy your Senses from Within

This is a manifesting exercise. Imagine you are in a situation in the future that you have wanted for some time – perhaps on a dream vacation, in a dream home, or with the partner you've dreamt of. Use your imagination to create as much of a sensory experience of this as you possibly can. If you don't "see" in your imagination, imagine how you'd feel, what you'd hear, etc. Are you at the beach, in a forest, skiing? Do you hear waves, birds, or the soft pitter-pat of snow? Is it warm or cold?

In your ideal home, are there breezes blowing through open windows, the whir of fans, or the hum of central air? Do you have music? Are there neighbors in a city situation or birdsongs in the country? Or are you in the suburbs with the subtle hum of traffic and your neighbor's lawnmower?

If you are with a partner, imagine yourself in a beautiful place or eating a wonderful meal. How does it feel to share a glass of wine over a fine dinner, sip tea at a picnic, or have a few beers at the local sports bar? How does it feel to embrace and feel secure and loved? Really get as sensory as possible in this inner world.

**As we become intensely present and appreciative of our sensory experience of the external world, we remove our focus from problems and point it towards a much higher vibe.** Likewise, as we go within and create imaginary experiences in our inner world we begin to attune to our own dreams and desires. Either way, we elevate our vibration. Either way, we remove ourselves from the lower vibrations and enjoy a simple and yet powerful way to elevate our own spirits.

In the midst of political unrest, virus variants, vaccines, and ecological mess, you can have an experience of the heaven on earth that has been waiting there, in plain sight, sound, taste, or touch, all along. And in that happier, higher vibe, guidance, solutions, and ideas for contribution become easy and obvious.

May we all "come back to our senses" and enjoy being human this week!

Love you all!  
Ann
