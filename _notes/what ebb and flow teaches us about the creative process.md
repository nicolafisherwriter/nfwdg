My philosophy of life has always been all or nothing. It can be a double-edged sword.

It leads me to throw myself, heart and soul, into whatever I'm doing. I burn the candle at both ends. Before I know it, my flow has ebbed away.

I reach a point of burnout and overwhelm. I regroup and pare back. I focus on good habits until, again, these practices are chipped away by a busy week or plate spinning.

Then I grind to a halt. The creative well is dry. I feel adrift. How can I have done it again? Have I learned nothing?

There's a deep sense of being out of kilter. Dragged away from my plan, I no longer recognise the terrain. My sense of true North has gone.

In the past, it seemed easier to burn everything down. A weight lifts immediately. I may have lost my bearings but it no longer matters.

Now, instead of throwing everything away, I take a step back. I rest, and use this state of limbo in which I find myself to let go, and recharge.

I find my lost mojo in the notes I write on the pages of my journals. Playing dot to dot with my ink pen.

My trust of the process is still imperfect. Like a flower, we experience the ebb and flow of growth.

Nothing blooms until you first sow the seeds. Then you wait. And wait some more. It may appear that nothing is happening but then you spot the new shoots growing.
