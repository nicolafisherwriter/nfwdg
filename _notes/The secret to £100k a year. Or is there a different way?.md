## My notes

So much of my feed is about six figure incomes, £100k years, millionaire lifestyles. Sometimes I look at the posts, check out the eCourses that promise wealth beyond your wildest dreams, and the roadmap to get you there.

Then I wonder: how do you find time? And where do you get the energy?

I'm constantly spinning plates. As are many people. 

Perhaps I just don't have that laser focus needed to earn a six figure income. Maybe my heart's not in it.
