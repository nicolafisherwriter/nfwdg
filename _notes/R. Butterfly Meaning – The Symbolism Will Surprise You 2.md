Seeing butterflies in nature is always lovely. Butterflies have such a magical presence and quality as they gently dance on the air, fluttering from flower to flower. They're so graceful and beautiful, seeing a butterfly always seems to have a way of opening my heart and reconnecting me with the magic and wonder inherently present now!

The symbolism of a butterfly is also so rich. Their life journey and expression is so symbolic of our own awakening journey, and spiritual path.This may even make you wonder:

Is there even more to the meaning of seeing butterflies than it at first glace seems?

Are butterflies angels? Are they messengers from the realms of spirit?

What insights do butterflies seek to reveal to us?

## Butterfly Meaning – The Metaphor of the Butterfly

 ![Seeing a butterfly is a beautiful sign of transformation. The life of butterflies is so symbolic of our own spiritual journey... Plus seeing their bright wings and light energy fluttering in nature has a way of bringing a smile and warming our spirit. Learn more about the meaning and symbolism now!](https://askangels-a8bd.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/butterfly-meaning-1-652x1024.jpg) **The spiritual meaning of a butterfly has to do with spiritual rebirth**, transformation, creativity, infinite potential, vibrant joy, change, and an ability to experience the **wonder of life.**

Observing the life cycle of the butterfly in and of itself holds rich symbolism and meaning.

Let's explore this:

Birthed from an egg the butterfly lives it's early life as a caterpillar.

It then retreats within the pupa or chrysalis where it undergoes a deep transformation.

Finally when it emerges from the chrysalis it is reborn as a beautiful winged being.

 ![The magnificent life of the butterfly closely mirrors the process of spiritual transformation... A reminder that we each have the ability to be reborn through going within. Learn more about the spiritual meaning of butterflies and what they mean for you. #signs #nature #beautiful](https://askangels-a8bd.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/butterfly.jpg) 

This _magnificent transformation the butterfly journeys through in its life expression closely mirrors_ the path of spiritual transformation we each have the opportunity to choose to take. Being in a spiritual path is not required… But it it available, and for those who choose it, like the Butterfly we can be reborn, completely transformed, we can find our wings and learn to fly but only when we first are willing to **retreat within.**

By retreating from the busyness of the external world into our inner being, we are able to cultivate and dive into a rich Stillness, Peace and Presence that simply is Divine.

When we surrounds ourselves in cocoons of prayer, meditation, spiritual insights and reflections, **we transform**. When we are willing to face our own shadow self, greeting all the aspects of ourselves we've not wanted to face… Welcoming everything, all that we are with love and with compassion, we transform. Through this inner journey, we heal, grow and evolve… We become ready and willing to emerge.

_To emerge like the butterfly, awakened and ready to fly!_ We're transformed and reborn into an entirely new way of being.

#### Butterfly Life Span

In addition to how they live their miraculous life, butterflies don't live long. They **typically only live for a few weeks or months** at the longest, which in and of itself offers more butterfly meaning guidance for us.

Guidance that life is short. Even for humanity, **time moves quickly**, and so the butterfly with its magnificent and yet short life, reminds us to enjoy the here and now.

I also like to think that the transformation of the butterfly, _as well as each of our own spiritual transformations, _ continue onward after death. With death, **our souls retreat from the physical world in a whole new way, but in this journey too when we have rested, restored our soul and are ready we will once again be reborn into another dimension.** Even after death our transformation continues and we get our wings, remember our full light, and remember how to fly.

Have you been seeing lots of butterflies lately, either in your waking life or in your dreams?

If so, the butterfly may be appearing as a power animal for you.

If you're not familiar with power animals, in many native earth-based cultures, **each animal was considered to bring messages** from spirit. By looking at the qualities of the animal, it's strengths, qualities, and tendencies, we're able to become aware of the message present for us through the power animal, from spirit.

As power animals, butterflies are magical and cherished. If you're seeing butterflies, you may want to ask yourself **what changes you're needing to make to live** more in alignment with your authentic truth.

What could you do to live with more joy and freedom? What could you do that would light up your soul and invoke a sense of joy and wonder?

Or perhaps you're already experiencing huge changes and transformations in your life, and the butterfly is simply appearing to remind you it's all going to be okay. Transformation is a normal part of life, trust in the process, and rest well knowing that the gentle medicine of butterfly is helping to guide you through.

**![Butterfly Meaning](https://askangels-a8bd.kxcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/butterflywithbamboo-300x300.jpg)Butterflies are a reminder of the Divine presence and magic in all of life, and a call to embrace and tune into it!**

## Butterflies And Angels

In addition to the spiritual guidance we can receive through the metaphor of the butterfly, and by looking at it's meaning as a power animal, when we see butterflies there is **often even more than meets the eye**.

Quite often angels and fairies use butterflies to remind us of their presence, and to send signals and validations to guide us through life.

### Why Would Angels Communicate Through Butterflies?

Butterflies have a way of capturing attention, and so the angels leverage these winged messengers of the **physical realm to help get their messages from spirit through**. And so… When you see a butterfly, pay attention! Quite your mind, and listen through your intuition, your subtle senses, thoughts, feelings, and inner vision that allows you to receive the message from angels that butterflies can help signal is present.

## Butterfly Meaning and Signs From Deceased Loved Ones

One of the most common questions I get about butterflies comes from those who have recently lost loved ones.

And guess what? Yes, butterflies are an incredibly common sign from deceased loved ones!

 ![The meaning of the butterfly is so spiritually symbolic and butterflies also are often signs of Heaven sent from our loved ones as a sign that their soul and spirit lives on beyond the physical.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20288%20453'%3E%3C/svg%3E) 

Seeing butterflies shortly after losing a loved is a beautiful sign that the spirit of your loved one lives on.

Have you had a butterfly land on you, follow you, or catch your attention in another beyond the ordinary way?

#### Angels Sending Butterflies?

In the case of seeing butterflies in connection to deceased loved ones, sometimes angels will send butterflies to comfort and reassure you that the soul of your loved one lives on.

Other times your loved one may put some of their soul essence into a butterfly to actually connect with you physically once again.

So there you have it. Really, looking at butterflies from a number of angles, the answer appears.

**These magical winged messengers really are delivering guidance and love from spirit.** 

So next time you see a butterfly, in addition to marveling at its lightness and ability to float through the sky… _Take a moment to quiet your mind_, pay attention, and with your intuition, tune in.

## Spiritual Meaning and Symbolism of Different Colors of Butterflies

 ![Meaning of Certain Colors of Butterflies](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20263%20358'%3E%3C/svg%3E) At this point, we’ve looked at the butterfly meaning, explored their connection with angels, and seen how they are a clear symbol of spiritual transformation.

But **what about different colored butterflies?** Does each color have a slightly different meaning?

Yes and no.

No, because all butterflies carry a message and symbolism of rebirth, transformation, joy, and tapping into the miracle of life in the present moment. All butterflies represent the soul and can act as signs of Spirit.

Yes, because different colors vibrate with a different energy, and so different colors do have a slightly different butterfly meaning, symbolic significance, and spiritual representations.

Let’s look at some of the added meaning behind different colors of butterflies.

Keep in mind that while yes, some butterflies are mostly one color, more often they have multiple colors. **Whatever the dominant color** of the butterfly will be its main symbolic significance, and the accent colors will offer further detail and clarification as to the symbolic meaning.

#### Orange, Black and White Butterfly

For example, a beautiful Orange butterfly with Black outlined wings and small White spots primarily resonates with the color Orange, but also carries symbolism of Black and White to a lesser degree.

When it comes to identifying the deeper meaning of butterflies of a certain color. Pay attention to what that particular color means to you.

#### Orange Butterfly

To keep with this example, Orange Butterflies are often symbols of encouragement, excitement, and passion. Seeing an Orange Butterfly may be a call to **stay positive, reconnect with joy** and follow your inner bliss and excitement to positively transform your life experience. But Orange has many other associations too. Orange is the color of the Sacral Chakra, and so an orange butterfly may carry symbolism of creativity, and connection with others for you as well.

#### Yellow Butterfly

Yellow Butterflies are symbols of joy, happiness and creativity. A reminder to _have fun_, to embrace creativity playfulness, and whatever it is that makes you happy. [A Yellow Butterfly's meaning](https://www.butterflyinsight.com/yellow-butterfly-color-meaning-and-myths.html) can also represent new life on its way, this may mean something fun and creative is aligning in your life, or more literally that someone new will soon be entering your experience.

#### White Butterfly

White Butterflies are symbols of spiritual change and personal transformation. White represents purity and innocence. Seeing a White Butterfly is often a sign that your angels and Spirit has a message for you, hence, it is a reminder to clear your mind, and open your heart to allow higher Divine guidance to reach you.

White Butterfly meaning also brings the reminder of your **direct connection with Spirit**, and the ability to recharge your energy with light and peace direct from Source rather than trying to “get energy” from others.

#### Black Butterfly

Black Butterflies are symbols of potent transformation. Seeing a completely Black Butterfly is often a sign that something in your life is up for review, and that you would benefit in letting it die and fade away.

This could mean letting go of a limiting belief, negative pattern or habit, or a way of relating to others and to the world. Remember that **on the other side of death is rebirth**… What do you need to let go of and “let die” in order for the transformative power of rebirth to emerge? Black Butterfly meanings can also represent the Divine Feminine, and entering into the void and unknown in order for new growth, life and transformation to be rebirthed.

#### Blue Butterfly

A blue butterfly is definitely a sight to behold. Blue butterflies can represent love, serenity, and inspiration.

Blue is sometimes a color associated with sadness, if this is what a blue butterfly brings up for you it likely does so to support your healing.

### Black as An Accent Color in Butterflies

Many Butterflies have prominent black markings as an accent color. In this case, the prominent color points to the _area of life in which you’re being asked to transform and change_.

#### Monarch Butterfly Meaning

A Monarch Butterfly is mostly a deep Orange Color with Black vein-like markings, as well as a Black outline along the outer edge of each wing.

The meaning of orange encourages you to dig deep to reconnect with your courage and excitement **to live in alignment with your passions and heart's desire**.

The black color meaning as an accent reveals that you need to let something in our life die and fade away in order to embrace the positive change and transformation that is possible and in store.

## What Does It Mean if A Butterfly Lands on You?

Having a butterfly land on you is such an incredible experience. When this happens, I believe the meaning and symbolism of the butterfly is even more significant for you. Pay attention! This could indicate the entrance into a new phase of life where you transform and begin to experience greater love, peace, harmony, and spiritual connection.

Alternately, in some cases when a butterfly lands on you, it is a sign from your loved one in Spirit. A **validation that their soul lives on and they are loving**, supporting and encouraging you to be happy and follow your heart to live in joy and love in your life now.
