1. Walk. Move more to feel better and to lose weight.
2. Eat better. Stop eating sugary stuff. Focus on fruit, veg and drinking more water.
3. Do things I love. Compile a list of what I love/used to love to do, and do some every week and small things every day.
4. Budget. Stick to the budget.
5. Listen to good stuff. Prioritise what to consume rather than going with the flow and listening to stuff that doesn't interest me.
6. Write every day. To be a writer, I need to write more and get into a routine.
7. Be organised. Get the plans sorted and follow through. Start a menu again and create shopping lists.
8. Clean the house in rotation. 
9. Talk to more people. Be inspired. Take in ideas. Expand my horizons.
10. Create projects. Define projects and see them through.
