Remaining grounded and balanced can be challenging at this time as we are being drawn inward to integrate the New Moon energies. With this integration waves of energy are being cleared from the collective in preparation for the upcoming eclipse season. As a result, we are being called to gather our energy and restore our reserves.

Knowledge is power and the more self-aware you are the greater your capacity for navigating your way through the uncertain and confusing landscape of our current world. Keep your focus inward on the choices and options that are emerging from within, as these will give you the necessary insight needed to restructure your life in a more positive and supportive way. Remember that this is a time of great inner change where you are walking a path into the unknown. Let your imagination and intuition guide you and do not look for answers outside of yourself. Trust in yourself and the wisdom you hold to direct your path.
