It’s one of my theories that when people give you advice, they’re really just talking to themselves in the past. — location: [29](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=29)We teach best what we most need to learn.

If we’re free from the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it. — location: [57](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=57)This is the creating/writing from abundance theory.

You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=70)

you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see. — location: [71](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=71)This is like notetaking. We save and keep the things that resonate and interest us. They become a collection that represents us, who we are, our essence.

You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. — location: [72](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=72)Our Second Brain reflects the sum of our influences.

The artist is a collector. — location: [79](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=79)A notetaker is a collector.
An artist is a collector.

artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love. — location: [80](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=80)

You’re only going to be as good as the stuff you surround yourself with. My mom used to say to me, “Garbage in, garbage out.” It used to drive me nuts. But now I know what she meant. Your job is to collect good ideas. The more good ideas you collect, the more you can choose from to be influenced by. — location: [82](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=82)

Marcel Duchamp said, “I don’t believe in art. I believe in artists.” This is actually a pretty good method for studying—if you try to devour the history of your discipline all at once, you’ll choke. Instead, chew on one thinker—writer, artist, activist, role model—you really love. Study everything there is to know about that thinker. Then find three people that thinker loved, and find out everything about them. Repeat this as many times as you can. Climb up the tree as far as you can go. Once you build your tree, it’s time to start your own branch. — location: [91](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B0074QGGK6&location=91)Notetaking has a lot to do with lineage. It's like going down the rabbit hole. We start at one node and head down others, linking our findings along the way, seeing connections.
