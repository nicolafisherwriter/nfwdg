## About

I'm Nicola. A Writer, Photographer, Podcaster, Geek.

I live in a small village in the Peak Park area of Derbyshire with my husband, [Chris](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk/), and his Guide Dog, Bamber.

I’m an INFP. I’m unconventional, quirky, an introvert and live outside the circle. That might make me eccentric!

I have an eclectic range of interests. 

## What I Believe

> I believe that, when we are who we are meant to be, we can change the world.

I believe in oneness. That we all originate from the same Source. And that we are on a journey to understand our connection to one another.

#### Oneness

I believe life’s challenges have the potential to be a catalyst for each of us to find our way home, but also to recognise that we all originate from the same source, leading us to acknowledge that we are all one. When we understand this, we will have the power to create a global revolution.

#### Creativity + Flow

I believe creativity provides the route to our essential selves, to our souls, to our essence, and connects us to the divine. It’s through our creative pursuits that we can find our flow and access our own wisdom. It’s in flow that our dreams take root and we tap into the universal mind.

#### The Unconventional Life

I’ve always preferred the road less travelled. I’ve been called eccentric and quirky. I value the freedom to live life on my terms and not follow the crowd. I’m [a Provocateur](http://www.howtofascinate.com/) and my default setting is to challenge the status quo and look for alternatives. I’m a quiet rebel.

#### Living Seasonally

My dream is to embrace a simpler way of life, aligned with the seasons. I want to spend time outdoors every day to watch the year unfold, and to nurture my connection to nature. I believe nature holds the answers and shows us the best way to take care of the planet.

### My Philosophy

If we want to change the world we live in, we have to start by changing ourselves.

- Finding out who we are, understanding what bring us joy and purpose, and connecting with our essence are the keys that align us with the core essence of the natural world.
- I believe that by taking better care of ourselves first, and then our family, friends and neighbours, we will not only build better communities but naturally have a greater desire to care for our planet.
- Until we see each other as members of the same community, understand how we are all connected by virtue of our humanity, we will never have the impetus to do what is necessary to heal the planet.
- Global events are catalysts to bring us together in community and serve as opportunities for change.
- We need to recognise our relationship to our world and the connection that exists between us, every living thing and the planet.
- If we all did those things that make us happy and bring us fulfilment, the net effect would be to make the world a better place.
- Living seasonally, and adopting the rhythms of nature could have a far reaching impact on climate change and our environment.

### Writing

I write about the intersection between tech and living at a gentler pace. I'm exploring the premise that, if more of us lived a gentle life, reconnected to who we truly are, or our essence, as I call it, we could change the world for the better.

I'm a former business advisor turned mentor, coach and writer. I focus on guiding others to put heart and soul into their life and work.
