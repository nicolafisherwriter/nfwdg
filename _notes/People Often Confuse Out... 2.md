## Highlights
- People often confuse output with effort 🤷🏼‍♀️
  Being a creator can be effortless if you find ways to increase your output without your effort. I believe we call that leverage.
  Here's what a typical leveraged shipping day looks like for me 👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1448202920357412869))

- First things first... ALWAYS BE BRAIN DUMPING
  I am constantly throwing ideas into my ideas list. My only rule is I have to do a brain dump when I have the idea.
  And stop sabotaging your ideas before they have a chance to fly. JUST.STOP.OVERTHINKING ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1448202921284444162))

- MOVE FROM IDEA TO UP NEXT
  Each week on a Sunday I'll spend time choosing a few ideas that I'm excited about into my Up Next Pile.
  Queries help me to bring up all those random ideas I've dumped in through the week

- CHOOSE THE BIG EASY
  Each morning I head to my Up Next Pile and choose my big easy. 
  Longevity for me has been finding joy in everything that I write. The trifecta of the big easy helps me find that joy everyday 👇

- LET IT SIMMER
  Once the big easy has been acquired I pin it to my sidebar and let it simmer throughout the day.
  Sometimes it just sits there as a reminder. Other times I'll add thoughts and notes as they come to me. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1448202931250008067))
- WINE AT 5
  About 5pm I go Joan Didion style where I sit down with a glass of wine and plate up the content to be served.
  Most of the heavy lifting has been done with my brain dump and the simmer and if I need something extra I'll head to my notes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1448202932038606850))
- MAKE FRAMEWORKS YOUR FRIEND
  Frameworks create a literal slipstream to get you into the flow. I have frameworks and starters for EVERYTHING:
  👉 Headlines
  👉 Lead In Tweets
  👉 Thread Starters
  👉 Essay Formats

- THE SMALL BUT MIGHTY CHECKLIST
  Checklists are unsexy little beasts. My checklists get me from draft to publish in 3 simple steps: 
  👉 Get me to Typeshare in one click
  👉 Make sure I'm not lazy and double-check my spelling
  👉 Remind me to enter my content into my database ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1448202934274215936))
