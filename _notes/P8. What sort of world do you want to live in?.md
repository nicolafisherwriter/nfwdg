What sort of world do you want to live in?

It’s easy to believe that we have no control. Yet even with everything going on in the world around us, we can create our own world.

Think about how you want to feel. How do you want to spend your time? 

_I want to be able to breathe fresh air. To walk outside. To see trees and fields and, if possible, cows. I want to be able to work on projects that are important to me. To share my vision, and to help other people bring their own ideas to life._ 

_I want to live in balance and alignment with who I truly am. To feel that I’m not compromising myself to fit in, but have the freedom to be me._ 

My questions for you to ponder are:

-   what do you want to invite into your world and what sort of world do you want to live in?
    
-   how can you start creating that world around you?
