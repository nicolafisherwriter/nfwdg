  - > Organic SPIRIT: Organic is a divine dichotomy: practical but spontaneous, structured but flowing. The disposition of Organic is like that of bamboo—light, incredibly strong, growing freely and prolifically. Organic is mindful of the connections between parts, whether in relationships, systems, or physical things. They keenly sense what's going on (never miss a thing!) and what needs to happen in order to create harmony and ease—Organic strives to unify. They are commonsensical, practical, and organized, and adore systems and solutions that simplify or create ease and efficiency. The challenge for Organic is to accept change without overthinking it, to trust what they already know is true. Organic is wholesome with pure intentions. Their feet are on the ground, and they are in tune with the natural order, seasons, and stages of living and working. LOOK & FEEL: Organic's aesthetic is based on sensuality, quality, and construction—whether structured or flowing, shape is important. Timeless or simplistic styles, and handcrafted, socially responsible or eco-friendly materials. Layered aromas, rich textures, enduring and natural fabrics and substances; hearty and sturdy; never static, (location: 455)

  - > The 80/20 Style Statement Principle THE POWER OF PROPORATION Proportion is defined as the agreeable relation of parts within a whole, or the appropriate combination of elements. If we find parts of ourselves or our desires in conflict or off-kilter, the 80/20 Style Statement Principle can help create balance and integration. This is the magic formula that makes your Style Statement a truly useful tool. The first word of your Style Statement reflects your inner foundation, your 80%. The second word is your creative edge, your 20%. This combination of energy, ideals, and aesthetics is a powerful equation for creating ease and results in life. Your Foundation is your 1st word—your 80%. (location: 494)


  - > SPIRIT » Your first word describes your inner foundation, which is your essence, the fundamental you. This is the core of you that feels like first nature, innate and implicit. » Your foundation is your “being.” » Your foundation is what you are. » This symbolizes your roots. » Being disconnected from your foundation is uncomfortable and disorienting. » Too much foundation can create inflexibility or righteousness. LOOK & FEEL » Your foundation word works as your basics do—like your suit or your dress, your essential clothing pieces. It may represent the overall style of your home, or it could speak to the big pieces or elements of your living space, like the style of your couch or the building materials and surfaces in a room. Your Creative Edge is your 2nd word—your 20%. SPIRIT » Your second word describes your creative edge, which is connected to your outer image and persona. This word typically represents the impression that we'd like to make or the experience we'd like to create. » Your creative edge is how you express your being. » Your creative edge is how you do what you do. » This symbolizes your wings. » Being disconnected from your creative edge creates a sense of emptiness or flatness. » Too much creative edge can lead to overwhelment or burnout. » Your second word represents the gift that you long to give the world, as well as the gift that you long to receive. LOOK & FEEL » Your creative edge works as your accessories do. It is the flourish of your fashion. It may be the finishing touches, or color or pattern of an outfit, a (location: 502)

  - > Bohemian SPIRIT: Bohemian is the ultimate champion and devotee of the arts, taking a stand for self-expression and creative liberty. Bohemian (location: 2066)


  - > derives soul-deep satisfaction from generating their own creative momentum and helping others to be seen, heard, and rewarded for what they do. Bohemian adores the unconventional, quirky, avant-garde, and slightly or outrageously offbeat. Truly, Bohemians have attitude fortitude! They put very little stock in what other people think of them, and when strict convention or pettiness encroaches, they tail with protest or hit the road without a second thought. Bucking the system makes them giddy with delight, but because they are so culturally informed and current, they can navigate with social ease whenever they wish. However, Bohemian can become prey to its own rebellious nature, and must consciously juggle self-determination with compassion. Bohemian is a free spirit, free thinker, a traveler of the world and of the mind. LOOK & FEEL: Bohemian loves to be up-to-date with design and often combine what's current with an eclectic collection of art, trinkets, and keepsakes. Culturally sophisticated: from high art to street punk.
