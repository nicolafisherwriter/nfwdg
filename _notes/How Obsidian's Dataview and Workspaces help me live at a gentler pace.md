When I started out on this journey to forge my own path, my plan was to write about the theme of _living at a gentler pace_. After a while, I realised it wasn’t that simple.

For one thing, I wasn’t living the life I advocated. I was spinning countless plates, often without time to grab a daily moment for myself. This disconnect was increasingly at odds with wanting to write about my so called _gentle life_.

#### once a geek, always a geek

I’d always been a geek but the discovery of Obsidian embedded tech in my life in a whole new way. Despite having used Evernote (for years) and Bear, I’d never embraced note taking like I did post-Obsidian. 

Whatever you want to call it, Obsidian was instrumental in enabling me to grasp the concept of a Second Brain, to start a process of personal knowledge management (PKM) and to build a library of content.

As I honed and streamlined my PKM foundation and neatened up the edges of my vault, Obsidian paid dividends. With each new note added, Obsidian just got better and better.

#### shifting my mindset

A combination of factors made me go all in with Obsidian. Reading different accounts on how to set up Obsidian, sourcing an alternative to [Obsidian Publish](https://nicolawrites.co.uk/), getting into (almost) [daily logging](https://nicolafisherwriter.co.uk/), and the [Linking Your Thinking Conference](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/lytcon/nick-milo-keynote) all inspired me. They led me to view Obsidian as my one stop shop information repository, and to use it as my writing tool.

I experienced a mindset shift and that made all the difference. Everything fell into place.

#### mission control

I created a few workspaces. One called Mission Control, a dashboard that manages my life, another for Writing Workflow, and a third space called Home and Garden.

I use a series of tags — seedling, budding and evergreen — to denote the stage of the note. I have a template called new note which contains references to projects (i.e. Medium/Substack/Newsletter/Note), a due date and a created date.

This data is then extracted using Dataview to build my daily plan (Mission Control) …

Writing Workflow

#### plain text — it’s the future!

With greater use, it became more important for me to keep all my writing in one place, even if it is distributed and published elsewhere too. As [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/plaintext) says:

> My written words are my most precious asset. They are also a history of my life. **That’s why I only use plain text files.** They are the most reliable, flexible, and long-lasting option.

Plain text is the future.

> Plain text files will be readable by future generations, hundreds of years from now.

> Derek Sivers

Plain text was the way I coded HTML websites in the past. There was a time when I used a .txt to do list, too.

But I didn’t grasp the benefits back then. Text was dull and boring, and I craved greater excitement than NotePad. If only Obsidian had existed!

#### the right tool for the job, for you

Even with Evernote and Bear, and copious notes, I didn’t get close to creating a Second Brain. I know many, including [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-use-evernote-for-your-creative-workflow/), use Evernote successfully to build their second brain. It doesn’t work as well for me as Obsidian.

There is an ease with Obsidian. Once you gain momentum in building your personal library, you can access information, associate it with other data, write about it and then share it.

This post started life in Obsidian. It will be published to Medium using iA Writer’s export function, via iCloud.

#### evolving your setup

Integration and automation might take time to establish, but once set up there is a benefit. You can start to operate at a gentler pace.

I remember years ago when computers were starting to emerge — we were told we would all have so much more time in the future. We would have more time for leisure because computers would make tasks quicker, or even complete tasks for us. In reality, we have less leisure time because we’re expected to do more, and do it faster.

In order to live the gentle life dream, tech needs to help us do less. It has to be a conscious decision.

By creating my workspaces, and spending time to assign dates to my notes, to tweak my templates so that they add value, in the long run I’ve clawed back some time.

Each day when I look at my plan, I don’t have to decide what I need to do, that decision has already been made for me.

With each new note, the tags I assign to it start it on its way through my workflow.

#### tech and living at a gentler pace

I want to understand the full extent of the link between tech and living at a gentler pace. I know there is a logical connection but I need to explore further. But that’s a post for another day.
