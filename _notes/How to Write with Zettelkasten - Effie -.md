When [Herbert Gold from the _Paris Review_](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4310/the-art-of-fiction-no-40-vladimir-nabokov) asked Vladimir Nabokov about his writing method, he answered rather straightforwardly, “I fill in the gaps of the crossword at any spot I happen to choose. These bits I write on index cards until the novel is done.”

That’s how he wrote _Lolita_, _Pale Fire_ and _Speak, Memory_.
