Some lack the fickleness to live as they wish and just live as they have begun ~ Seneca

We think that fickleness is a negative trait, but if it pushes you to be better and find and explore new, better things, it certainly isn’t. I’ve always been a proponent of dropping out, of quitting paths that have gotten stale. Seneca’s quote has helped me with that and I actually have it framed next to my desk so that I might look at it each day. It’s a constant reminder: Why am I still doing this? Is it for the right reasons? Or is it just because it’s been that way for a while? ~ [Ryan Holiday](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3Dc56863ada7%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C78248a7578ac4b1ea9ec08d9450d1563%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637616744756611757%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=tq1MZyWn1GxNHTIHlyR8QdJzLyJZSxTphAEUSDasZLY%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=c56863ada7&e=d0baf97615.
