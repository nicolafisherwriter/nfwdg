I haven't written anything for a while. I've simply not had the headspace. There have been too many other plates spinning and I think there's only a finite number of plates that you can spin at any one time. I don't know what that number is but I think we all have a number.

I've been busy with other things. Trying to generate income being the main one. I've had to change some of my plans and, for a while, writing is going to be my side hustle. It wasn't where I envisaged finding myself. But I'm simply not earning enough. As the anxiety about continuing to be able to pay our bills has increased, my creativity has bombed.

I am the breadwinner. The responsibility for paying the bills lies at my feet alone. Not only that but I fund my husband's work and have done so since 2016. Despite having achieved a certain level of press and publicity, his work does not pay.

There comes a point when you realise that you can't continue as you were. Our hopes and dreams about achieving some financially viable success haven't panned out yet. Perhaps it will, perhaps it won't. But I don't have time any more to wait for that moment to come, if it ever does.

There's relief in having made the decision. I've lost count of the number of nights I've laid awake, anxious about how I'm going to manage to pay the bills, where I can generate income, pondering why I'm not making headway. 

Most of all, I've not written anything because my head is empty of creative ideas. For some time now I've been unable to sit and come up with anything worth writing about. The muse has deserted me. Even though I have ideas in Obsidian, they feel flat.

I'm waiting for the dam to break. For whatever is holding me back to start to flow. I hope it happens soon.
