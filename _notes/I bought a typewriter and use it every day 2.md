# I bought a typewriter and use it every day

Sometime in December, we watched a documentary film called [California Typewriter](https://californiatypewritermovie.com/). About a shop of the same name that serviced and sold typewriters, it also featured well known typewriter users like Tom Hanks and Sam Shepard. It was, without a doubt, the best thing I watched in 2021.

Even before we had reached the end of the film, I was already plotting how I could acquire a typewriter of my own.

Years ago, my Mum had a very large and very heavy typewriter. A Smith Corona, I think. She taught me how to type by covering up the keys of the typewriter to encourage me to touch type. I wasn’t a big fan at the time but it was a skill that has stood me in good stead since.

Later, I bought myself an electronic typewriter with a lovely keyboard and an in-built memory. A halfway house between a manual typewriter and a computer.

This time I was in search of a fully manual machine. And I found one. An Erika 155, I drove half an hour down the road to pick it up. In pristine condition and very little used, it was an absolute bargain.

It was a much more deliberate experience than typing on my Mac keyboard. I carefully selected the keys one by one, until I speeded up again and found my typewriter flow.

#### a daily download

Every day I feed a sheet of A5 typewriting paper into my Erika machine. Sometimes I have an idea I want to explore, sometimes just a single sentence. I start typing and see where it takes me. Real stream of consciousness stuff, I type what pops into my head.

I date each page, type _Thoughts …_ and keep going until I run out of things to say.

It’s a very mechanical process. If I make a mistake, unlike autocorrect, I back type XXXXXX and carry on. More like handwriting, there’s a brain/hand coordination going on.

Typewriter typing is a different experience. I can understand why many writers still use a favourite machine as you’re tapping into a more creative part of your brain. And, if it was good enough for Sam Shepard, it’s good enough for me!

#### writing epistles

I’ve always been a letter writer. Dating back to when I first started handwriting, every birthday and Christmas my Mum would sit me down to write thank you letters. It’s a habit that has stuck and writing these letters has become one of my small pleasures.

Since getting my Erika 155, I’ve written at least one letter a day. If there are no thank you letters to write or replies to send, I’ll go through my contacts list and choose a lucky letter recipient!

The reasons for letter writing might be tenuous. _Saw this and thought of you_. But, once I get started, my typing covers several pages.

#### people love typewritten letters

Without exception, every typewritten letter has elicited a happy response. _How nice to receive a typewritten letter_. _Wow, that was a lovely surprise_. _You don’t see many typewritten letters these days_. Etc etc.

Some people remember typewriters and tell me stories of the time, pre-computers, when everything was typewritten. For others, it’s something quirky and novel.

There are even websites where you can find other typewriter fans and exchange typewritten letters. I’ve signed up, of course!

#### a cult following

Typewriters may be making a comeback!

California Typewriter gave glimpses into the scale of the appreciation that exists for typewriters. Some people own hundreds of typewriters. Oh, to have the space!

There are books about typewriters. Gatherings called type ins. [Businesses](https://charliefoxtrotvintage.co.uk/collections/typewriters) who restore, service and sell vintage typewriters.

Search _typewriter_ on Instagram or Pinterest. There are typewriters for sale on eBay and Etsy.

#### the quest for the pink typewriter

Tempted as I am to acquire countless typewriters, I’m restraining myself. But, I will make an exception for the right pink typewriter! How gorgeous would that look on my desk!
