> ... centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances ... every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent ... the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn’t doing anything different than he had ever done ... but everything would align. And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human. He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity ~ Elizabeth Gilbert, TED Talk

This is flow. It’s the switch that connects us to the primeval magic within, a magic that we have forgotten, a magic that we no longer nurture and expand. A magic we deny ourselves through busyness, through distraction and demands on our time. 

It is our essence.

It’s there, waiting for us, hoping that just maybe we will tap into it before we shuffle off this mortal coil.

Some years ago I began exploring an idea that I called essence. Our unique blueprint, it's a combination of everything we love and who we are. We find it by looking within.

My essence is unconventional and eccentric. It takes me down the road less travelled and lives along the edges.

When we’re in alignment we tap into who we are meant to be, our best selves. We are touching the source of our being.
