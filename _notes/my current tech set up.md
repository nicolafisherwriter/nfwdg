## To Do List

Dynalist - it has a clean interface with Google Calendar synchronisation and recurring tasks. Deceptively simple Dynalist has helped me get things done in ways that other more bells and whistles apps haven't.

## Note taking

Obsidian - not only is this my note repository, it's where I write my books, essays and blogs. I use Obsidian Publish to share my public writing. My private Walled Garden folder contains notes about my business and clients, Kindle highlights, Readwise references as well as some works in progress.

## Email

Outlook - I migrated from Gmail to Outlook at the back end of last year. 

## Napkin

## Matter

## Otter
