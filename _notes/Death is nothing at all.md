It’s 6 months since my Dad died. Although I didn’t know it at the time, I think there was an element of shock. While it was feasible for him to die when he did as he had not been 100% well, it was still, in so many ways, unexpected. I was surprised about 3 months along the path to feel more upset than I had before. 

The first weeks were surreal. You do all the normal stuff. Arrange a funeral, choose hymns, venues etc. Send thank you cards to well wishers. See people. I remember the first day I went back to work, a week after my Dad had died. I would have gone back sooner but the death had been referred to the coroner which delayed all the paperwork. I walked from the car park through town functioning as if through a veil. Fortunately, my first appointment was cancelled so I sat in a cafe stupefied. I tried to bring forward my second appointment but couldn’t. 

The day after the funeral a neighbour asked if I was ‘alright now’ as if a magic wand had been waved and everything was back to normal. I facetiously said ‘of course, I’m fine’. But it grated. The irony was missed anyway. 

I’ve cried every day. Not the heart wrenching sobs of the early days. Sometimes it’s been eye leakage. Silent tears falling down my face. As I’ve been sorting through the never ending paperwork, personal effects, childhood memories, surprise finds, the tears have come. Mostly in private. 

I’ve realised for most people that death is nothing at all. It’s a 5 minute wonder if it’s not happening to them. Sometimes even those, like the aforementioned neighbour, who have been through their own bereavement, don’t seem to register when it’s happening to you. 

Only a few have extended any compassion. I’ve found that those who do are usually not people I previously classed as my closest friends. The adage, you find out who your friends are, is so true. 

Kindness comes in unexpected places, from strangers. Moments of connection that are never forgotten. 

Of course, people will tell you that they didn’t know what to say. Far better to say something rather than nothing at all. Not acknowledging what has happened is worse than ignoring it. 

After the funeral you’re expected to be back on track. You’ve ticked the box, now it’s time to move on. But your emotions don’t work that way. They don’t realise they’re on a schedule. So, you stop talking about it (heaven forbid you might bore someone), you bite back the tears (better to suppress it than embarrass), and the healing takes longer. 

Death, like birth, is a rite of passage. For the person who dies, they leave behind a legacy of their life, whatever that might be. For the people left, a new chapter begins. But, as with any change, a period of adjustment is needed. 

I didn’t appreciate how profound a change it was to be without both my parents. When my Mum died, I still had my Dad. We could talk about my Mum and, although she was no longer there, many of the pictures and ornaments she loved still surrounded us. It was as if she might walk into the room at any moment. My Dad could still tell me about our combined history. I was still a daughter. 

Now with them both gone, that part of my life is over. It all still seems unfathomable. I can play life by my own rules. Yet I find myself wanting to make them proud of me. 

I met someone recently who I hadn’t seen for some time. We were acquaintances rather than friends. I didn’t know her well but we had a catch up and I said both my parents had died. She asked how I was and said it was a big thing when your parents die. I said, ‘is it?’. 

None of us knows how we will react when something major happens to us. We hope we will handle it well. I suspect we’re all different in how we deal with things too. There’s no one size fits all.
