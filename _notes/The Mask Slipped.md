Occupying the last pew, Johnny looked down at his immaculate shoes. 'I hate bloody funerals', he said to no-one in particular. The church was packed with mourners, mostly Chinese, all grieving for his late boss, Mr Han, whose death a week earlier had been unexpected.

Johnny had been Mr Han’s driver for almost ten years. He had been something big in the art world, but Johnny had never been privy to the transactions conducted in the meetings. The only indicator of a good deal was if Mr Han told him to drive to Bibendum, his favourite restaurant. 

Today would be the last time Johnny drove the silver Bentley. He returned it to the opulent mansion in Mayfair, parking it in its usual spot next to the other supercars, and giving it a final clean, before hanging the key on its hook. The wake was in full flow. Johnny had been invited but it wasn't his scene. He was a back room boy preferring to get his job done and stay out of the way. Although Mr Han had been a great boss, Johnny never considered him to be a friend.

But he went in the house to say goodbye to Samantha. As soon as she noticed him she came over, holding an envelope in one hand and a small briefcase in the other. 

'My father wanted you to have this'.

Johnny opened the briefcase. Inside was the gaudiest and ugliest piece of Chinese art he had ever seen. Even to call it art seemed a stretch of the imagination. 

The contents of the envelope were more pleasing. A cheque for £50,000 for services rendered. 'That will do nicely', thought Johnny.

Later, and back at home, his wife was relieved when he showed her the cheque. At least they would be OK until Johnny found a new job. She hated the gross thing in the briefcase. It looked cheap and tacky. A joke from beyond the grave? That would be Mr Han’s style. He'd had a warped sense of humour.

She handed it to Sam, their young son, who immediately loved it and started to play with it.

There was another piece of paper in the envelope. An A4 sheet, typewritten, it began ...

'The enclosed is an early version of funerary art, dating back 3,500 years. It is of significant importance in Chinese history'.

As she started to call to her husband, 'Johnny ...', she glanced over at her son, watching as the mask slipped. From his hand. And smashed into countless pieces on the floor.

She looked down at the words at the bottom of the note.

'If you ever want to sell it, call Jerome. He will handle the sale. You'll never need to work again!'
