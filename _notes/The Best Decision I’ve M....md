## Highlights
- The best decision I’ve made recently is to add delays to everything:
  -no email gets answered for 48 hrs
  -no meeting gets scheduled before 1 week out
  -no project gets launched w/ < a month notice
  I paradoxically end up moving faster because frivolous stuff gets eliminated ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1430005347608002563))
- I realized nearly all the frivolous, low value, urgency driven, reactionary work happens when someone needs something “at the last minute”
  By deliberately creating a slower cadence to my work, I reduce anxiety, allow more time for deep work, and dont have to be online constantly ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1430006965501980672))
- By basically choosing not to be open to messages, meetings, and opportunities that require fast responses, the pace of my days slows down, there are fewer emergencies, and everyone around me learns to give me more notice on things 
  I act more in accordance with my goals & values ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1430007302724100102))
