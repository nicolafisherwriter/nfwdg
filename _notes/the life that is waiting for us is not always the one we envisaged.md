title: the life that is waiting for us is not always the one we envisaged

The death of my Mum was the catalyst for a series of events that would lead me to my future husband.

Bereavement is a major life change that often puts us into a state of limbo. A chapter has ended and we go through a process of adjustment and letting go. A new beginning is on its way.

Mine involved a house move, a new job, and a complete change of circumstances. I hadn't envisaged any of it, but simply made room for something else.

## I had no plan

I'd severed ties with my past and closed doors. I was busy, and had no thoughts about the future.

But my world started opening up again. I had moved on.

I had also made a future husband sized space in my life, although I didn't know it at the time.

## I'd put myself on a new path

The journey through change, endings and new beginnings is fascinating - in hindsight, we can see the milestones along our path.

My Mum's death was one of these milestones, setting me on a different trajectory.

A chance connection led me to a new job. One of my new clients invited me to an event. There I met Chris. Milestones leading me where I needed to be.

## You never know what life has in store

I couldn't have predicted any of this. Over the past 8 years, my life has changed out of all recognition. My life has unfolded in the most incredible ways. Yours can too!
