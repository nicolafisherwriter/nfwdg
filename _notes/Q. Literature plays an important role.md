I think literature has a very important role. It can play a role that is healing. I think that when a child has read a book, they should be able to go away with a feeling that some little part of their individual inner desert, that inner desert that has been urbanised and degraded by contemporary life, can be made to bloom again. Stories that help them re-experience the experiences they have. Stories that make them realise: it's not so bad ~ Beryl Gilroy, [Black Teacher](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=7ddaf021a8&e=eb9759f735)
