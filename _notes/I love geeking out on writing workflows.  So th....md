## Highlights
* I keep
* For that, I use nothing but Muji notebooks & pens (if you know, you know).
* I keep a simple page called "Daily log" where I track each day I'm writing & brainstorm ideas (moving them from Drafts to Roam).
* I don't have a complex note-taking system, Notion dashboard, or anything like that.
  * **Note**: Napkin, Twos, NotePD, Obsidian.
* (These are 99% procrastination anyway.)
  * **Note**: They can become procrastination but a good workflow helps. There is a discipline to making sure your tools are actually working for you.
* Drafts syncs directly to my computer as well.
  * **Note**: Can this sync to Obsidian via Mac?
* I keep a running note called "ideas" where I dump anything (literally anything) that comes to mind while I'm reading, walking, or listening.
  * **Note**: Need to manage inbox process better. Napkin is capturing my ideas but is this enough?
* I also do a good bit of handwritten journaling when I want to do my deepest thinking.
