title: what changes when you live at a gentler pace

Looking back over my career, there are very few times when I truly made a difference. Much of the work I did has no value now. It's all been forgotten. I wish I'd understood earlier that there was a different way.

The nudging began in my thirties. All I remember are the countless trains, planes and automobiles that ferried me up and down the country.

I always felt that there had to be something more.

## Don't leave it as long as I did to find your 'something more'.

It's easy to think when you're in your twenties or thirties that life stretches out ahead of you.

Until, suddenly, you find yourself twenty years older and with not much to show for it. A gentle life is about living your dreams. It's about taking some time to tune in, reconnect and discover what gives your life meaning.

If we don't carve out the life that we truly want to live, someone else will do it for us.

## 1. Allow yourself to enjoy life

I have to give myself permission to relax and have fun. Maybe you do too.

Life is short. Live it now.

## 2. You make room for new experiences

Here, say why it's so important.

Do more of what brings you joy. Make time for it.

## 3. There's always another way

Being true to yourself is the key to loving your life.

We may have always lived and worked in a certain way, but it doesn't mean we can't change.

What sort of life do you dream of? It's never too late to make it a reality.
