## Highlights
- If you use it right, Twitter is the most powerful platform in the world. 
  But Twitter does a horrible job of showing you its advanced features.
  Here are 10 of them you probably know nothing about: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914220411985926))
- The most underutilized Twitter feature: advanced search. 
  It blows my mind how few people know this.
  Want to find someone's best tweets?
  In the search bar, type:
  from:dickiebush min_faves:500
  Replace the handle and the number of likes as you see fit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914228288847875))
- Another good advanced search tip:
  Want to see everyone's tweets on a particular topic?
  In the search bar, type:
  from:dickiebush "consistency" 
  Again, replace the handle and keyword as you see fit.
  You can filter by popularity too:
  from:dickiebush "consistency" min_faves:100 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914230444765189))
- We all have those people we don't want following us, but don't want to block. 
  Here's a good hack:
  Block them, then unblock them.
  This will unfollow you, but they'll never know. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914237260496898))
- Get mentioned in a tweet that is receiving way too many replies, turning your notifications into a disaster?
  I've been there. 
  Click to expand the details of the tweet, then click the three dots on the top right-hand corner.
  Then, click "mute this conversation." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914239097610245))
- Everything changes when you start to mute words on Twitter. 
  There are too many options to explain in a single tweet, so here you go: 
  https://t.co/s8tqkW4285 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914241169547267))
- Have multiple interests? 
  Start to create different Lists for each of them.
  Then, pin them to the top of your timeline and swipe easily between them.
  It's like having multiple Twitter accounts in the same place.
  And it also stops you from doomscrolling. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914243040206848))
- Now for a few practical tips on writing effective tweets and threads: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914249814044675))
- I see this mistake so often.
  Someone puts together a great thread, but starts it by tagging someone with an @someone
  Starting a tweet with an @someone will make Twitter think it's a reply and hide it from your followers.
  Find a way to start your thread or tweet differently. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914251831508992))
- Go easy on the links.
  Twitter penalizes links to external content. 
  If you want to share your newsletter, website, blog post, or podcast, try this: 
  Write some copy to pique the reader's interest, then link to it in a reply underneath that tweet. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914256160038916))
- Formatting matters. 
  The difference between an average tweet and a great tweet comes down to style.
  The easiest upgrade? 
  • Lists
  • Using
  • Bullets
  Look way better than:
  - Lists
  - Using 
  - Dashes
  How to find them:
  • Mac: Option + 8
  • Windows: Alt + 7 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914257997144066))
- This is one of the biggest engagement hacks out there. 
  If you want to resurface a tweet back to the top of everyone's timeline, don't retweet it.
  Simply reply to it with a follow-up question or additional tweet.
  Twitter resurfaces the top tweet + two most recent replies. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1376914264770904065))
- And that's it!
