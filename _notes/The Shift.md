## Highlights
the plate-smashing heroine of Revenge of the Menopausal Woman. — location: [96](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=96) ^ref-7739

---
The Shift from living a life spent contorting yourself into shapes that accommodate the male gaze, to being in the happy position of being ignored by it. And you know what? You won’t care. — location: [104](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=104) ^ref-63350

---
a lot more attitude, confidence and, quite possibly, rage. Quite a bit of rage TBH. Because if there’s one thing menopause gifts you, it’s a righteous fury; an indignation and a staunch inability to suffer fools, injustice and inequalities. — location: [110](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=110) ^ref-45030

---
‘I’m no longer accepting the things I cannot change. I’m changing the things I cannot accept.’ — location: [112](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=112) ^ref-61078

---
It’s time we grasped that invisibility society has bestowed on us and saw it for the blessing it can be. — location: [129](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=129) ^ref-26031

We have power. (Trust me, we do! It just might not always feel like it). So what if you’re ‘bossy’ or ‘aggressive’ or ‘difficult’ or all those other things women have always been accused of? It’s called knowing your mind and standing up for yourself. Get used to it. And, in the immortal words of almost every woman ever, ‘I love it when they underestimate me.’ Because while they’re not paying attention, you can cause trouble and be disruptive right under their noses, in a way that you never could when you were paying rent in ‘their world’ with your youth and beauty. — location: [138](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=138) ^ref-54580

---
we’re still standing. We’re strong. We’re resilient. We know more than ever. Now it’s time to channel it. — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=154) ^ref-23738

---
We are bigger than the box – if only we realise we’re allowed to be. — location: [158](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=158) ^ref-47433

---
As Gwyneth Paltrow said in The Sunday Times Style, ‘You’re no longer A/B testing all your behaviour and all your stuff out there in the world, because you’re done, you don’t give a f***, you’re like, “This is me.” ’ — location: [159](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=159) ^ref-55619

---

I have totally lost sight of myself. I do not know who I am any more. — location: [235](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B081DPZX7J&location=235) ^ref-64636
