Brainwashed & Hypnotized.

What these types have in common is how their minds can change with the wind, they have no core belief system, no functional conscience, so a dramatic shift in popular opinion can come quite easily if there is enough momentum behind it. Enough shattering of the obvious falsehoods which allow the truth to push through.

And thats what gives me hope and keeps me optimistic for the future.
