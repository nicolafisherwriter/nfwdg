I'm a geek. Tech excites me. Especially in the context of making life easier, productive or automated.

I enjoy beta testing something new, looking for possible uses, thinking laterally about how an app could be helpful. Mostly, I love mastering something I've not used before.

I write about my favourite tech and tools. I talk about how I use apps and share what I've learned to make tech easy for others.
