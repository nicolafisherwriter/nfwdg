## Highlights
- “Career was my identity. Now I realize it’s all a capitalist scam.”
- “Already pretty radical. But lately rethinking if the nuclear family is even a viable social unit. Feels like we need more close people than that. Like dolphins, we may need pods.”
- every one I know is ready to burn it all down.”
- “I’ve started to accept, accommodate and honor my disability rather than just push through.”
- It's time to completely rethink money and finances in this society.”
- These are the signs of a civilization not just in decline, but on the precipice of collapse.
- These ideas might feel threatening or different or uncomfortable, but that’s what happens when you rebuild in a way that’s not simply trying to approximate what was there before. It’s weird, and disorienting, and confusing — until it’s not. It’s just the way things are.
