# how do you make people feel?

I used to park regularly in a car park at Castlefield in Manchester. I'd arrive early, around 06:30, just as Mike, the attendant, was opening up. We would chat about something or other. He was always very nice to me, and one day he waived my parking fee, just because.

He had worked at the same job for 25 years, meeting and greeting, and taking payments. Mike died 3 years ago aged 47. One night he sat down in his chair and had a massive heart attack.

He was _just_ a car park attendant but he made a lasting impression - on me and many of the other regulars too.

Making a mark doesn’t have to be grand gestures but basic human connection with others. It’s the simple things that make the difference and touch our heart.

On those dark, damp Winter mornings he would often say, somewhat ironically, 'another day in Paradise'. I like to think he has finally found his Paradise.

There’s a plaque now in the car park. Mike’s Place. In memory of Mike Robinson. His legacy lives on.
