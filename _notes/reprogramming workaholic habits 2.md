# reprogramming workaholic habits

I didn’t post any writing yesterday. I was tired.

In the past, I would have pushed through, worked on until everything had been ticked off my list, despite how exhausted I was or how late the hour.

This was my working life for many years. I’d been brought up to believe that work was my top priority but I was also my own worst enemy. .

In April 2019 I resigned from my day job. A catalyst, one weekend, made me realise that time was finite. Less than a month later I was no longer employed.

I had no real plan. I just knew what I no longer wanted to do. Instead, I craved time outside, and to fulfil my quest to live at a gentler pace.

I floundered for several months. In the absence of a better routine, I did what I’d always done. At my desk by 08:30. Working all day.

I was like a ship without a rudder.

Then, in September, we decided to live in the countryside, and to move to Derbyshire. This was possible because I was no longer tied to a day job.

Two years later, we’re here, settled in our new house. My freelance work has taken off and the old habits return.

I’m learning that living at a gentler pace requires discipline. It’s a practice. You have to deliberately factor it in.

These days I recognise the danger signs. Maybe not straight away but eventually.

That’s why I didn’t write yesterday. I put my feet up and relaxed instead.
