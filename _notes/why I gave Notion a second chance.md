title: why I gave Notion a second chance

_I started using Notion seriously a month ago and this is what I've learned!_

Although I'd briefly explored Notion back in April, it was Ev Chapman's Focus Hub that showed me its plus points. I thought my use of Obsidian made Notion superfluous. I was wrong!

Notion is for planning, Obsidian is for thinking.

## New Tech Challenge

I love a bit of geekery, and the challenge of mastering something new.

Starting from the foundation of Focus Hub I was able to deconstruct the different elements, and personalise my setup. This method helped me appreciate the scope of Notion.

## Addition to my Workflow

Once I'd worked out where everything fitted in, Notion has slotted into my writing workflow.

Ev's Consumer 2 Creator was perfect for Ship 30 for 30, and I've tweaked it to match my own process.

## A New Website

I've used Notion for my November 30 day challenge, publishing a new entry every day for participants.

It's quick, easy, very WYSIWYG. I used Host Notion to link up a domain name.

## Not for Writing 

Notion doesn't appeal to me as a writing tool. I much prefer the Obsidian interface.

But I love the way I can link databases, filter, show different views, monitor progress, and add formulas.

## Recurring Dates - or not

You need workarounds for recurring dates.

Apart from that, I've used Notion to plan my weeks more effectively than the whole host of to do apps I've used previously. In fact, not using dates is proving an advantage.

## Don't discount Notion

Obsidian and Notion are apples and oranges. I'm glad I gave Notion a second chance!
