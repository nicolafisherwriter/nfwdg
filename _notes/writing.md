When I quit my day job in April 2019 in a bid to forge my own path, I came across someone who seemed to be doing exactly what I dreamed of. She had created a writing life. We spoke and then I went off in a different direction because I didn't think I should copy what she was doing.

For almost three more years, I did a range of other things. I was a self-employed Business Advisor, website creator, eCourse host. I talked a lot about living at a gentler pace and my Essence Map. The latter never really gained any traction.

In April 2021 I first came across [[Obsidian]]. It transformed my view of writing. An evolution had taken place. Writing was no longer in the style encouraged by my English teacher at school. There was a new way. Digital and online writing. 

As I explored, first PKM and then Second Brain, took part in Ship 30 for 30, wrote atomic essays, made lists, and re-joined Medium, a realisation began to dawn. Perhaps I could be a writer.

There were signs of encouragement. Kind words, positive comments. Unsolicited emails about a post or article. And then, income on Medium. All of these spurred me on and made me double down on my efforts.

Then, one day, I decided I had to go all in with my writing. So I did.

I'm currently writing ...
