Obsidian changed everything for me. It took me on a journey of transformation that I still can't quite believe.

Note taking was something I did throughout my life. Notes that never really went anywhere. Obsidian made my notes useful. It showed me the connections between ideas and joined the dots. It led me down a path called PKM and Second Brain. It lit a fire beneath me that has never gone out.

It's thanks to Obsidian that I went all in as a writer. From Obsidian to PKM to Second Brain, I discovered *writing with abundance*, as described by David Perell. I took part in Ship 30 for 30 hosted by Dickie Bush and Nicolas Cole. I learned about digital writing and atomic essays. Tim Denning taught me about Medium and Substack. Countless others on Twitter inspired me with their own processes and writing life.

Writing became a possibility and it all started with Obsidian.
