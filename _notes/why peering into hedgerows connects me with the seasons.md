title: why peering into hedgerows connects me with the seasons

For years I’ve scrutinised hedgerows, looking for subtle details heralding the advent of a new season. Since our move to Derbyshire these tiny changes have become even more apparent.

I’ve watched as, first, snowdrops appeared, then bluebells and dandelions. One succeeded another, each new flower having its moment in the spotlight. As the hedgerow expanded the flowers moved from ground cover upwards through these ancient boundaries.

There’s a flow through the seasons until, finally, berries appear. The hedges are cut back revealing, somewhere in the middle, my favourite dangle berries. Strings of red, bead-like, threaded through hawthorn and ivy.

I like to check on the progress of the local hedges every time I walk down the lane. To track the changes, to monitor the evolution. I love to log the often unseen details, evidence of these changes. I photograph decaying leaves, the light illuminating a dandelion clock, trees month by month, and berries in various stages of ripening.

I probably look like a mad woman peering into the hedge. But that’s where you find treasure. Often some gnarly branch with a hidden beauty. A feather hanging by a thread from a thorn. Some sheep's wool tucked into a gap.

Surveying hedges is the best way I’ve found to connect with the seasons, to take note of what's new.

Why don’t you give it a try? Notice the small things and watch the year unfold.
