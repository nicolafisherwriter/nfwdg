## My notes

Every so often I rationalise and declutter. I need to as I buy domain names like some women buy shoes, and can't resist building websites for myself.

I've been contemplating how I can merge some of the sites I have and combine my writing into one place.

I recently created a WordPress website for Nicola Fisher | Writer by cloning A Gentler Pace - this meant that I brought over all that website content. Since then, I've set up a redirect to Nicola Fisher | Writer. So, A Gentler Pace is all but gone.

Nicola Fisher | Writer is a very clean and simple site with basic information. It's a jumping off point. I don't intend to build a blog there but to link to my daily log and digital garden. 

The more I use Obsidian, the more I value having all my writing in one place. Should Medium or Substack ever disappear, a copy of all that content will be in my vault.

I've started writing letters and notes that need to be shared in Obsidian. I export them to PDF and attach them to emails. This change in mindset has led to other aha moments.
