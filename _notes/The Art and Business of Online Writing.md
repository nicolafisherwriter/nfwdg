  - > it was missing the most important piece of the puzzle: there was no social component, no way for readers to explore and discover new, interesting writers. And without this discovery feature, the likelihood of someone coming across my blog was slim to none. (location: 132)
    How do you share content where others can read it apart from Medium?

  - > Gamers, on the other hand, know that you have to play Level 1 over and over again in order to reach Level 2. And then you have to play Level 2 over and over again before you can reach Level 3. And if you can just keep on keeping on your journey, learning and mastering each level, you will eventually climb all the way to the top of the ladder. That’s how you “beat the game.” (location: 180)


  - > For six months straight, January to June of 2016, I kept up this writing routine—while still working nine hours per day as a copywriter, while commuting an hour on the train to and from work, and while eating five meals per day and hitting the gym for an hour and a half every night. I worked. I lifted. And I wrote. And then every night when I got home from the gym around 9:00 p.m., I’d make myself a plate of gluten-free pasta, asparagus, and chicken, and work on my first memoir, Confessions of a Teenage Gamer, until midnight.

  - > Substack is still in Phase 1. In 2019, the platform raised $15.3 million from one of the most well-known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley—Andreesen Horowitz (a16z). This means some very smart people are betting on the growth of the category of “paid newsletters” for writers and media creators. If this category continues to grow, and Substack is the creator of this category, then you better believe the platform is going to grow exponentially over the next five plus years. For this reason, I’ve already moved my own newsletter over to Substack. (location: 1501)
    How can I effectively use Substack and Ghost?

  - > If your goal is to be a successful writer, then social platforms are for publishing first, and consuming second. I have a rule I live by, and it goes like this: “The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.” (location: 1526)


  - > We are afraid of sharing who we are today—because we believe who we’ll be tomorrow will be “better.” This is a vicious cycle. (location: 1550)


  - > In order to be taken seriously on the internet as an authority in your category and a leader in your industry, niche, or genre, you need to be writing and publishing new material 2x per month. (location: 1603)


  - > All that matters is whether or not we keep spinning the wheel and playing the game. (location: 1630)


  - > For example, if you wanted to “beat me” at the game of online writing, and acquire all the achievements I’ve acquired, all you would need to do is: Publish something new every single day (because I publish something new every single day). Write fast-paced articles that use short paragraphs, declarative language, and subheads for every main point. Combine actionable advice for the reader with personal stories from your own life that illustrate how you gained the insight you’re sharing in the first place. Collaborate with professional photographers, build your personal brand, and attach pictures of yourself with the articles you write. Publish more than 3,000 articles online over the next five years. Contribute dozens of articles to Inc Magazine, Forbes, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, Business Insider, The Chicago Tribune, The Huffington Post, TIME, and more, to build your Perceived Credibility. Land a few speaking gigs, and capture pictures of you speaking to illustrate more Perceived Credibility. Speak on 100+ different podcasts, illustrating even more Perceived Credibility. Etc.
