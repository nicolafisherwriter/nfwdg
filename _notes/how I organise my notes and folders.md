I've taken a lot of my initial inspiration from Nick Milo, creator of [LYT Kit](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/).

I've also been inspired by [Eleanor Konik](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/00+Meta/03+Structure/Welcome) and the [[R. Johnny Decimal]] system.

[This video by Effective Remote Work](https://youtu.be/oETBOXhdGPs) about productivity also influenced some of my system.

When I decided to publish some of my notes I thought that it would be easier to separate them out into public and private folders. So, initially I had a Digital Garden for public notes and, to continue the garden theme, Walled Garden for private ones.

The consensus seemed to be that notes didn't need to be organised into sub-folders but using Obsidian is a constant evolution and I'm now using folders. 

I also use backlinks and tags for further organisation and to facilitate search, and this is where Obsidian comes into its own.

I had been experimenting with prefixes for my Notes titles e.g. 

B = Book
P = Project
Q = Quote
R = Reference
W = Writing 

which groups Notes alphabetically and by type.

However, now I use folders, I've deleted those prefixes.

I've created an [[ðŸ“š index]] of all the hashtags I'm using and put these into groups.

In the Walled Garden, I've created a Daily Notes folder for the note that is generated each day. I've designed a template for the notes and the daily note auto-creates from this template.

I have private folders for:
- Goals
- Projects
- Plans, Reviews
- Work Projects
- Finance, Home, People
- Writing
- Attachments, Templates
