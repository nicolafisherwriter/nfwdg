## Highlights
- An employer isn’t going to care about you if a car runs over your beautiful body tomorrow. They’ll simply rehire another warm body and place them in your office chair within a few weeks. @tim_denning #twtd 
- I did it for me. I did it for the people like me who were told their entire lives that they couldn’t be somebody.
- After hours side hustles are for underdogs.
- Looks don’t matter as much as you think. You’re beautiful just the way you are.
