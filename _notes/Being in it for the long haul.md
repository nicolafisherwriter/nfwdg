I was fifty-eight years old when I finally felt like a "master choreographer." The occasion was my 128th ballet, The Brahms-Haydn Variations, created for American Ballet Theatre. For the first time in my career I felt in control of all the components that go into making a danceâ€”the music, the steps, the patterns, the deployment of people onstage, the clarity of purpose. Finally I had the skills to close the gap between what I could see in my mind and what I could actually get onto the stage._

Why did it take 128 pieces before I felt this way? A better question would be, Why not? What's wrong with getting better as you get more work under your belt? The libraries and archives and museums are packed with early bloomers and one-trick ponies who said everything they had to say in their first novel, who could only compose one good tune, whose canvases kept repeating the same dogged theme. My respect has always gone to those who are in it for the long haul. When people who have demonstrated talent fizzle out or disappear after early creative success, it's not because their gifts, that famous "one percent inspiration," abandoned them; more likely they abandoned their gift through a failure of perspiration ~ Twyla Tharp, [The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=c2ebd97d45&e=eb9759f735)
