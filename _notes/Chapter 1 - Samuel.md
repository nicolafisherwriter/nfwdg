1984

A short American, [[Samuel]] wore a [Dr Who-style scarf](https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/23/doctor-who-the-origin-of-tom-bakers-scarf-revealed) from the Tom Baker era long before it was even a thing. Friendly with everyone, people liked him but dismissed him as being a bit quirky. This was his cover. Amiable, a bit of a bumbler. Instantly forgotten. Visible yet invisible at the same time. He would sit, unnoticed, in high backed armchairs, listening. A notebook in front of him, covered with his inky handwriting, spidery across the page. An almanac of key facts. They would come in handy later.

Samuel was the archetypal American in Paris. From a tiny town in Vermont, he left to escape the crushing sense of community - he craved anonymity, a bigger place where he could merge into the background. Just be himself.

His home was a canal boat on the Canal St Martin. Every night as he walked home from his classes at the Sorbonne, he would check the skips along his route, extricating anything he could use or repurpose or even just burn.

This was the mid 1980s. Recycling wasn’t yet universally popular. Samuel had been a recycler all his life. His mother, a single parent, never had any money. With three children and an absent father, her options were limited. She became resourceful. The eldest, Samuel, was recruited to help her skip surf. Mostly in search of food, Samuel soon started noticing other interesting throwaways. Toys. Bikes. Books. Prioritising the search for something edible, his Mom discouraged him but one by one, he brought home what interested him.

He tried to find items that needed only a little work. His DIY skills weren’t great at that stage. He learned on the job. Before too long his sister and brother had one or two toys each. And books galore.

Having satisfied his immediate need he began to contemplate making some money. One day he was skip surfing outside an old bookshop. Hundreds of ancient books, all discarded. He couldn’t believe it. Curious as to why so many were being skipped, and trying to plan how he could get more home, he went into the shop.

It was a mess. In one corner the walls were black. A smell of smoke hung pungent in the air. An elderly man stood alone in the room.

“Excuse me, Sir, would it be OK for me to take a couple of books from your skip?”

“They’re all smoke damaged but you’re welcome to any of them. There are some classics in there, sadly worth nothing now.”

Samuel took a proper look. Some of the titles meant nothing to him. Old tomes about philosophy and science. He put a couple to one side though because the illustrations were glorious. He found some classic novels like Moby Dick and Mr Pickwick’s Papers, plus an early edition of Samuel Pepys’ diaries.

‘Is it OK if I take these?”

“Good choices. That one is rare. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.”

“Thank you, sir, I’m sorry for your troubles.”

Back home Samuel put his stash in a metal chest and locked it with a key. He would come back and have a proper look when he knew he wouldn’t be interrupted.
