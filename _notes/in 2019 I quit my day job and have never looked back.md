_In April 2019, I quit my day job. I wanted to embrace life at a gentler pace. It didn’t quite go to plan!_

For the first six months I exchanged my old work routine for … more of the same. Up early, at my desk, work work work. I didn’t know how to break the cycle. There was comfort in my busy-ness. But it wasn’t my dream.

I learned that living a gentle life might not always be simple but it was one of my best decisions.

### **#1. Sometimes you just have to jump.**

Life is short. The death of someone I admired was the catalyst for me to grasp the nettle and begin to create the life I craved.

If I hadn’t made that leap, I would still be in my old job now, in my old house, doing the same old same old.

Instead, I live in the heart of 500 square miles of English countryside in a new house, in a different county.

I didn’t overthink my decision. I listened to my gut.

### **#2. Doors will open.**

I had no plan. Just a desire to live a different type of life.

Once I left my day job, cogs started whirring. Until I made that first move, the others couldn’t follow.

Six months after I quit the 9-5, my long held dream of living in the country came true. I’d opened a door and walked through it.

### **#3. The plan doesn’t have to be fully formed.**

All I had was an idea. That has evolved over the last two years in ways I never imagined.

I’ve followed my bliss and, for the most part, gone with the flow.

I should have done it sooner but everything happens in perfect timing.

Seize the day And your dream.
