<p>If you’ve been following my progress since I started this website, you might have noticed my recent rebrand to A Gentler Pace. I wanted to share with you how this unfolded.</p>



<p>I’ve been here before. I’ve gone down a road until I can go no further. Around 15 years ago I had a website called the Whole Self whose premise was not dissimilar to the Essence Map, which still remains at the heart of everything I do. Then, as now, I reached a dead end. I hit a brick wall and couldn’t work out how to go around it. I thought it was all over. So, I burned everything. Literally and figuratively.</p>



<p>I was a big believer in burning bridges. Purging what had gone before. It always felt as if I had to go back to the very foundations and begin again.</p>



<p>Coming across this quote: may the bridges I burn light the way, (attributed to Dylan McKay’s character in Beverly Hills 90210), made me think of my actions more as illumination than destruction.</p>



<p>Somewhere along the way and, after the burning of many bridges, I found myself revisiting old ground. The concepts of the Whole Self followed me. They evolved, eventually becoming the Essence Map, and then finding a home in Seed to Source. Each time something was added, a further clarification emerged. My own life was mapping the map.</p>



<p>I came to realise that Essence wasn’t going to go away. Perhaps it just needed tweaks and some editing. It was the theme that has pursued me throughout my life. I would never be done with it but needed to find a way to adapt and shift with it.</p>



<p>After a year of working on Seed to Source, writing content, developing ideas, launching a podcast, I was surprised to find myself at yet another impasse. I didn’t know where to take it any more. I seemed to keep bumping up against the same blocks.</p>



<p>I did think that perhaps I needed to press pause indefinitely. Perhaps I’d gone as far as I could.</p>



<p>I found it hard to post on Instagram, one of my favourite things. I had run out of things to say. Yes, the well might have run dry too but that’s a topic for another day.</p>



<p>I’d lost my thread in my Facebook group, and the proposed eKit garnered no interest.</p>



<p>Around the same time our house sale and purchase fell through. Both on the same day. And at the Solstice, a time of regrouping, reviewing and new beginnings. I saw it as symbolic of the need for a different direction. In the end, neither of us regretted the lost house purchase. It had been a nice idea but as new options landed on the table, a whole brighter future opened up for us.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was this moment of reset that created the shift I needed. Maybe it was a weight lifting as I contemplated a more appealing future. Whatever it was, something changed.</p>



<p>The week after the Solstice, I spoke to a man who specialises in shamanic healing. He took me on a journey back to my childhood, to when I was three. It all made sense and explained a lot. He showed me the burden I had been carrying all my life. I’m still letting this understanding percolate and it’s going to be the subject of a post all on its own. But it demonstrated why my relationship with my Mum had always been so difficult and why believing in my own self-worth had been a lifelong challenge.</p>



<p>Perhaps this conversation shifted something too. I decided to change the colour scheme on my website. Back to my favourite, pink. I thought that was enough.</p>



<p>Over the next few days, I started re-reading old blog posts and kept coming across a phrase which jumped out at me &#8211; a gentler pace. It took me back to the reason I started Seed to Source. To live a different lifestyle. To work on my own terms. To leave the rat race. To spend time outdoors. To live a meaningful life. To help others in some way.</p>



<p>I’d lost touch with the entire original rationale for leaving my day job. I’d recreated the whole relentless work ethic, just in another format.</p>



<p>So, I checked to see if <a href="https://www.instagram.com/agentlerpace/">@agentlerpace</a> might be available &#8211; it was. Everywhere. What about the domain name? Yes, that was available too. Within a couple of days, I’d claimed the username and bought the domain name, migrated my website across and redirected Seed to Source there. I even found that the hashtag had never been used. Meant to be? Maybe.</p>



<p>It feels as if I’ve opened up a door in that brick wall that I was bumping up against. Perhaps we don’t have to find a way round, just through.</p>



<p>I’ve thought about what I truly value and what I always wanted to do. A lot of that was around writing. I love writing. I love journaling. I don’t profess to be the best writer in the world but I love the process.</p>



<p>I remember coming across the wonderful <a href="https://helenredfernwriter.com/">Helen Redfern</a> some time last year, and thinking, this is what I want to do. And, then I wandered off in other directions. And now I’m back where I started.</p>



<p>Writing. Podcasting. Photography.</p>



<p>I’ll still be talking about all the themes underpinning Seed to Source. But living at a gentler pace seems to make so much more sense to everyone. It also encompasses everything I believe.</p>



<p>Living at a gentler pace is where we find ourselves again, reconnect with nature, take time to be joyful and hear the whisper of our inner voice.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would like to join me on the next leg of this journey.</p>
