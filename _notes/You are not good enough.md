When we hear this voice in our head that says "you're not good enough," "it's all been done," et cetera, et cetera, what makes that so powerful against us is we think it's our own thoughts. We think, "Oh, that's me assessing the situation objectively." But it's not! It's this other siren voice, this force that's just out there, that's a fact of nature and once we can say, "Oh, that's not me," that kind of is the key to the whole thing ~ Steven Pressfield
