I've never been much of a talker. Contemplation and percolation were my things. 

I'm an Introvert and not a fan of phone calls. Unless the call is pre-arranged or initiated by me, I've never enjoyed long drawn out chatty calls. Apparently, this is quite common among Introverts.

Email was a life saver. I could send long messages quite happily but it was voicenotes and audio that were life changing.

My preferred app is Voxer. It's free to use, easy to use and several of my friends have it too. I can easily chat away for 15 minutes - or sometimes more. It works for me because I choose when I want to send messages, listen to messages and there's no pressure to be present at a specific time.

Instagram voicenotes are OK too but not long enough. The 60 second limit is a bit annoying!

Telegram has some good audio functions but not enough of my contacts use Telegram to gain any traction there.

Clubhouse is another great tool. I love the non-video element. It's like a live podcast in which you, as a listener, can also participate. I'd like to create my own rooms there but, again, early days and not sufficient traction in my circles as yet.

A term that's popped up lately is *asynchronous*. This means being able to respond when it suits you rather than on demand. It's the *on demand* element that I find challenging.
