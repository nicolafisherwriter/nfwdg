# my naive vision

> We have to escape the life of commodity and replace it with the life of community. Whatâ€™s going to be required is a conversion of consciousness. I call it plant consciousness ~ Richard Powers

I'm not an economist but, every time I hear reports about climate change conferences or world leader summits, talk of legislation and targets for 2050, I have a sense that we're going down the wrong track.

The answers being considered are all about money. Making money, investing money. It seems to miss the point.

I've contemplated for a long time a world without money. Perhaps we'll never get to that point but what about a world where the focus wasn't on money, wasn't on making as much profit as possible, wasn't on giving the fat cats more cream to skim off the milk!

I don't think my contemplations are unique. I see others sharing a similar take on the world and our planet.

Mary Portas has been someone I've been following recently. She talks about the Kindness Economy. In a TEDx Talk Mary speaks about how business left no room for human kindness but was focused on greed, gain and work. She recognises, too, that the world has to change.

She talks as well about bringing our authentic self to work. This is what I've shared - how we need to connect to our essence, our truth, our authentic self and how that could change the world.

When we live a gentle life we take a step back and slow down, which leads us to reconnect with the world around us. And to each other.

I have a vision, naive maybe, of a world where we each have what we need.

-   We coexist in community
-   We share our unique gifts
-   The seasons are our clock
-   We reconnect to the earth and ourselves
-   We find fulfilment where we least expect it

In changing our perspective to _Planet-Society-Economy_ (Ron Garan, Astronaut), we shift our focus on to the world around us. We see the symbiotic relationship between us and everything in nature.
