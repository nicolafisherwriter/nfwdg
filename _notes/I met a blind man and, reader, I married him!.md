My husband has never seen me and never will.

Chris had been completely blind for 7 years when we met. It was a glorious sunny day in May when our paths first crossed at a charity event. I'd intended sitting with the other event photographers at lunch but their table was full. So, I sat next to Chris.

It was a novel experience for me as I'd never spoken at length before to anyone who was blind. Or been able to ask so many questions. Chris was very gung ho about it all!

I had no idea that day would change my life.

## You don't need sight to be able to see

Over the years very few people have really understood what makes me tick. In just a few hours Chris _got me_ in a way few ever had. He saw deep into my soul. It was absolutely compelling.

## It's not about looks

We clicked. We both found someone else on the same wavelength.

Over the next few months we became the greatest of friends. I have an irreverent sense of humour. This, combined with Chris' politically incorrect approach to his blindness, laid the foundation for our relationship.

We laughed. A lot.

## Marry someone who cheers you on

Chris embraces all of my quirks (there are a few!). He encourages me to embrace them too. He's seen who I truly am.

We are Team Fisher. Both there for each other.
