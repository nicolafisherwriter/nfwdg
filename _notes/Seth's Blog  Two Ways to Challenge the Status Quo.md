## Highlights
- Culture shifts slowly. “People like us do things like this.” Seismic events may make newspaper headlines, but they don’t rapidly change the way human beings in community behave.
    - Note: The rate of change of behaviour by human beings is slow. Seismic events are merely the catalysts. Following them is a process to assimilate what has happened, rage against it, accommodate it, come to terms with it, and then understand that the previous normal has gone. We quest for normal but are on an ever evolving continuum.
- the status quo erodes, redefining itself as it goes.
    - Note: Creating the new ‘normal’.
- you won’t change your beliefs until the people around you change as well.
- the slow move toward culture shift.
