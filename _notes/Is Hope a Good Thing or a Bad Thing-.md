## Highlights
* I hoped things would turn out differently. When I’ve dragged out hurtful situations, it’s because I’d hoped they might change.
  * **Note**: Hoping and hope are two separate things.

Hope is the thing … quote.
* Hope encourages you to create new endings
  * **Note**: Hope and to hope - two separate things.
