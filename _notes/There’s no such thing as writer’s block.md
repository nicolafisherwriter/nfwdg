_"Write something  
Then improve it.  
Then write something else.  
Repeat this process until you have a post.  
Then post it.  
Then repeat this process.  
There’s no such thing as writer’s block. There’s simply a fear of bad writing. Do enough bad writing and some good writing is bound to show up.  
And along the way, you will clarify your thinking and strengthen your point of view.  
But it begins by simply writing something."_
