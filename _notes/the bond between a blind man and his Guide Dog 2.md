# the bond between a blind man and his Guide Dog

On 6th October 2017, an 18 month old German Shepherd Guide Dog came into our lives.

Named Bamber by the supermarket that sponsored him, he was paired with my husband, Chris. For the first fortnight, Chris and Bamber stayed at home, bonding, followed by ten days residential training. For Chris, not Bamber. He learned all the commands, how to walk with a Guide Dog on a harness, and to navigate the streets.

When I went to pick them up at the end of training, they were already a team.

For the first year, Bamber really wanted nothing to do with me! I was an inconvenience who got between him and his Dad. But, gradually, he warmed to me. I knew I'd made a breakthrough when Bamber camped out with me in my office as I worked. From then on, he became a regular study buddy.

The bond between the two of them runs deep. Whenever I take Bamber for a walk, he's chomping at the bit to get home and back to Chris. Bamber will squeeze on to our two seater sofa, in between us so that he can be close to his Dad. Imagine a 50kg German Shepherd snuggling up like a toddler!

Bamber is now 5 and he and Chris have become a well oiled machine. Out and about, Bamber works like a trouper, finding pedestrian crossings, guiding Chris around town, taking him where he needs to go, giving him independence. They communicate silently, each movement through the harness sending signals both ways.

There's a mutual, deep love between them. It's a special thing.
