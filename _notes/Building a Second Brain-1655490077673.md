## Highlights
Human capital includes “the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans—their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition.” — location: [188](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=188) ^ref-10686

It’s so easy to dismiss ‘human capital’. I’ve worked for so many organisations who recruit you for your skill set and then reduce your input to a few specific areas. So much useful knowledge goes to waste.

I began to call the system I had developed my Second Brain and started a blog to share my ideas about how it worked. — location: [204](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=204) ^ref-62625

The origin of the term ‘Second Brain’.

---
We extend beyond our limits, not by revving our brains like a machine or bulking them up like a muscle—but by strewing our world with rich materials, and by weaving them into our thoughts. —Annie Murphy Paul, author of The Extended Mind — location: [229](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=229) ^ref-42787

---
For centuries, artists and intellectuals from Leonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a “commonplace book.”* — location: [259](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=259) ^ref-37247

---
the commonplace book was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in it. — location: [262](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=262) ^ref-60801

---
Robert Darnton explains the role of commonplace books: Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality.* — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=265) ^ref-43253

Like your Digital Essence. A commonplace book is a reflection of you. A Second Brain is as unique as you are.

Writer and photographer Craig Mod wrote, “There is a gaping opportunity to consolidate our myriad marginalia* into an even more robust commonplace book. One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text we consume.”6 — location: [286](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=286) ^ref-30532

However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others. A studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready to be put to use in the outside world. A whiteboard where you can sketch out your ideas and collaborate on them with others. — location: [291](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=291) ^ref-33926

---
As you share your new idea with your colleagues, they start asking questions, pointing out valid concerns, and adding their own contributions. At each of these moments, you are ready to save them as notes in your Second Brain. You withhold judgment, seeking to gather the widest possible range of feedback before deciding on a course of action. — location: [375](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=375) ^ref-59022

Lends itself to introverts too who need time to allow ideas to percolate.

---
There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: distill your notes down to their essence. — location: [640](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=640) ^ref-63030

---
Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate. — location: [641](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=641) ^ref-62903

It’s clear that we need food and water to survive. What may not be so clear is that we also need information to live: — location: [714](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=714) ^ref-52940

Information isn’t a luxury—it is the very basis of our survival. — location: [716](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09MDNDYYF&location=716) ^ref-38257
