Whenever it feels as if you're writing in a vacuum, remember that what you do matters. Every act of creation brings hope... A story - the right kind of story - can reach across continents. A story can change the course of a life. The right words, in the right order, can accomplish anything...

Remember that just writing is an act of bravery. You have the courage to do what it takes to give your voice the chance to be heard. Don't do it because you want to be the next Maya Angelou or Margaret Atwood. Those are already taken. Do it because your voice is unique. Only you can take this chance. No one else will ever be you, or tell your story the way you can. So writers, write: with joy and love. You may not all take your stories as far as you'd like to take them. But write them, and send them into the world like dandelion seeds on the wind, because love and joy exist to be shared, and maybe, one day, they'll come back to you ~ Joanne Harris [Ten Things About Writing](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3Dbba365f0ae%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C0a02fd861c4249d34ccb08d963b28a21%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637650440735485284%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=IqjGqKa9%2BSbWAfC1HTnLx%2FCJoWZGdYN5bsBJKRF84kU%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=bba365f0ae&e=d0baf97615.
