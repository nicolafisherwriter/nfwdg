My voice being irrelevant in a room of people does not matter to me as long as my voice is relevant on the page. And I believe it is relevant. But why?

Because I do the work, I read, I think, I listen to my peers, I contemplate my intentions, I try to write from the truest of places inside of me, I practice my craft over and over again, and for all those reasons I believe that my work is worth reading. I cannot make anyone read it. But still: I believe it is worth reading.

The minor note in a sea of voices. Who cares? I can fucking sing!_

When you hear that voice telling you you’re not important, play with it if you can, interrogate it, argue with it. And if that doesn’t work, drown it out with all the reasons your voice matters. Write it in a letter, write in a notebook, text it to your best writer friend. You control the argument. You decide your worth.
