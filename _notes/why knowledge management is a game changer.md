Yes, I'm going to mention Obsidian again! It was a door I walked through earlier in the year which led me into a secret kingdom. The realm of personal knowledge management, as some call it. I've been going down the rabbit hole ever since.

My life in both the corporate world and my personal life would have been transformed if some of these tools had been available back then but it's really the interconnection between tools available now that makes everything work.

### the analogue version of knowledge management

For most of my life I've been a consumer of knowledge. As a child I was an avid reader. In the absence of books I read breakfast cereal boxes. I had great recall and, whenever I wanted to look up something, I could go straight to the book and to the page. I remember phoning my Mum once when I lived in London asking her to go to a specific shelf in the bookcase, picking out a book fifth from the left and giving her the page number and the paragraph.

I would write notes about my reading. Apart from remembering which notebook contained which note, there was no real way to organise my thinking. I didn't know about Zettelkasten back then, or contemplate a similar index system. Most of those notes are now gone in the big burn of 2020 when I purged old papers.

### digital note taking

Although I used Evernote for years, Bear for a while, and dabbled with Notion, it was Obsidian that transformed my note taking. Partly because of the community around the app, and the vast array of plugins available but also the availability of my notes across a variety of platforms, also accessible by other apps that can open text files.

### from consumer to creator

It's David Perell who first introduced me to the concept of not just being a consumer but becoming a producer or creator. What do we do with all the information we consume? How do we make it work for us? How do we remember or access it later? And, what information do we want to consume?

I watched a video this week that David shared from his Write of Passage course. He talks about the process of capturing information and funnelling it through various apps to create a workflow.

### the new workflow

I love my Kindle. Although physical books are always a favourite, I reached a point long ago when I no longer had space for them all. The first time I gave away books was gut wrenching. They represented my life. There were much loved books that had been read, not just once but several times. It felt as though I was giving away my children. After that, I became more conscious of my book buying habits and less attached. Once Kindles arrived I saw the potential of being able to read hundreds of books but without the space requirements.

I've often highlighted text. In the past it just sat there, doing very little. With Obsidian, a simple plugin allowed me to extract my Kindle highlights into the app. There they are searchable, can be tagged and imported into other writing.

David takes the process a step further and this, for me, is where the genius lies. As well as highlighting, you can add your own notes. Ideas sparked by someone else's writing are no longer lost. They can also then be used as the basis for your own writing so that you are no longer defeated by the blank page.

I've started using Readwise which extracts the notes I write as well as all my Kindle highlights. From there it's a simple sync to Obsidian and both highlights and notes can then be retrieved and used.

This was a real game changer for me. It enabled me to use what I was reading more effectively and also gave me a starting point for some of my own contemplations.

By using a tool such as Matter, I can do the same with articles, both my own and those suggested by the app. I can highlight and add notes and then sync to Readwise.

If Obsidian made me more productive in my writing, these new additions to the process have made me more effective.

Matter suggests writing I might not have discovered on my own leading me down completely new avenues and to very different ideas. This has boosted my own thoughts with fresh thinking.

Information starts to really work. Instead of being an accumulation of knowledge, it becomes something that can add value and be explored.

It is also the basis of David's concept of writing from abundance rather than scarcity. By managing the transit of information, you automatically impact the outputs.

Of course, not all inputs are good and David talks about knowledge consumption in terms of diet. Not all information is equal, and we need to manage what we consume to achieve the end result we're looking for.

### writing from abundance

I've been a Blogger for longer than I can remember. 30 years ago I hand coded HTML websites where I shared my random jottings. I used Blogger for a while, Tumblr, Postach.io plus countless others before moving on to WordPress and now, on to Ghost. Throughout all that time I started writing from a blank screen or page. It never occurred to me that I could use someone else's writing as a starting point - surely that would be akin to plagiarism?

It's hard work writing from scratch and it can take me ages to pull together my ideas into some semblance of coherent thought.

David's process, together with tech, revolutionises that.
