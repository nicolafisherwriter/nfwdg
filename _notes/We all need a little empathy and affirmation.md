_"Writers tend to be so paranoid about talking about their work because no one, including us, really understands how it works. But it can help a great deal if you have someone you can call when you need a pep talk, someone you have learned to trust, someone who is honest and generous and who won't jinx you. When you're feeling low, you don't want anyone even to joke that you maybe in some kind of astrological strike zone where you'll be for the next seven years. On a bad day, you also don't need a lot of advice. You just need a little empathy and affirmation. You need to feel once again that other people have confidence in you. The members of your writing group can offer just that."_
