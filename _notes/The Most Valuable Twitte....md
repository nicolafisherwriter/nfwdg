## Highlights
- The most valuable Twitter feature you aren't using: 
  Advanced search.
  Knowing how to use it will help you find the hidden gems of the Twitter archives and 10x your Twitter experience.
  Here's the step-by-step guide: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615906678542341))
- Most Twitter users know nothing about advanced search.
  And the few that do think you have to access it this way: by clicking the three dots in the search bar, then clicking advanced search, then using these fields.
  This is painfully inefficient.
  Luckily, there is a better way.

- You can leverage the power of advanced search right in the search bar using text.
  And there are six different things you can create filters for:
  â€¢Â Date
  â€¢Â Keywords
  â€¢Â Number of likes
  â€¢Â Number of replies
  â€¢Â Number of retweets
  Let's dive into how to use each. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615950710358022))
- Before we do that, you might be thinking, what does this do for me?
  Twitter is a real-time platform. 
  But the Twitter archives are full of gems.
  Especially from some of the most prominent people on Twitter, you can learn a lot by combing through popular things they've said. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615954527272961))
- The foundation of advanced search is the "from" query.
  Every query will start like this:
  from:handlename
  An *important* note: do not include the @ before the user's handle. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2_8yumXIAMMMEJ.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615966510288903))
- Want to see someone's tweets during a certain period of time?
  Easy. Just use the "until" and "since" query
  from:dickiebush since:2021-01-01 until:2021-02-01
  An *important* note: dates must be formatted in "YYYY-MM-DD" format with no space between them and the colon. 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2_8zxDWUAMw2qq.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615982998200325))
- Want to see someone's tweets with a specific keyword?
  Just put it in quotes after your from:handlename
  For example: from:dickiebush "Twitter" 
  And if you like to get fancy, you can combine them with an "OR" to look for multiple words.
  from:dickiebush "Twitter" OR "writing" 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2_80ZJXoAYjLEI.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400615994377265159))
- What if you want to see someone's most popular tweets?
  You can do that too.
  Filter by number of likes, replies, or retweets using any of the following:
  â€¢Â min_faves:100
  â€¢Â min_replies:100
  â€¢Â min_retweets:100
  Example: from:dickiebush min_faves:1000 min_retweets:1000 
  ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E2_81BoWQAgi4nb.png) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1400616005429346304))
- Advanced search gets fun when you start to combine queries. 
  For example, what if I wanted to see what @APompliano was saying about Bitcoin during 2018's crash:
  from:apompliano "bitcoin" since:2018-01-06 until:2018-02-06 min_faves:2000
  The man practices what he preaches! ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²

  The TL;DR of what you can filter:
  â€¢Â "keyword"
  â€¢ min_faves:1000
  â€¢Â min_replies:1000
  â€¢Â min_retweets:1000
  â€¢Â from:handlename
