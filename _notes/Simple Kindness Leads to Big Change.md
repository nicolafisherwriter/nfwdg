**1\. Start with yourself  
**  
_Tend to your own garden and your roses will inspire the world._  
  
Kindness comes naturally when you feel good inside. When you take care of yourself, tend to your own body, mind, and soul, you want to share the good feelings. You want to see others happy. you want to let others know they're beautiful, talented, kind, valuable, and loved.  
  
So the first step to kindness is to be kind to yourself. Hug yourself. Compliment yourself. Soothe yourself. Take care of your body. Read things that inspire you. Do what makes your soul sing, no matter how small.  
  
_One happy person is a lighthouse on stormy shores. Your kindness to the world starts with your kindness to yourself._  
  
**2\. Let Your Heart flow through your Lips**  
  
Sometimes you look at a total stranger and think something wonderful about them. They're beautiful. They look so strong. They have a beautiful smile. They handled their kids with such grace. If inclined, speak up. Say, "I couldn't help but notice, you radiate and shine. You have a beautiful smile. You handled your kids with such patience and grace! What a loving parent you are. We need more like you in the world"... and so on.  
  
It feels weird at first. When I started letting my "heart flow through my lips " I felt awkward. What if people think I want something from them? What if they think I'm hitting on them? What if? What if? I got over it. I stopped worrying about what others thought. And of course, I discovered the great blessing that it is to bless others.  
_  
There is no greater satisfaction than seeing a soul light up with joy because their light has been seen and acknowledged._  
  
**3\. Let Your Heart flow through your Actions**  
  
When you feel inclined or inspired to do something kind for someone and it feels good to you (good means God's guidance, not ego!) then do it. You might feel silly but if you get the inspiration, trust that this is one of "God's errands."  
  
I've baked muffins for the convenience store clerks, brought cookies to the local postal center, helped people carry stuff to their cars, prayed with people begging for money, etc., and not because I'm trying to be some holier than thou person, but because it just felt right at the time. It felt good.  
  
_When God wants you to do something you'll feel good about it too, and so will the receiver of the love flowing through you!_  

While it is easy to look at the world's chaos and feel despair, we're the ones changing it â€“ one kind word, one kind deed, one kind prayer at a time :)
