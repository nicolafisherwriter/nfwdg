## Highlights
- Our hurried way of living makes us fair game for those “dark forces”
- It’s not frivolous to slow down and notice everything. That’s the lifestyle of an artist, which is really a lifestyle of meditation.
- Those simple souls who spent their lives simply enjoying the beauty of what we are given and then letting it pass may have gotten much closer to the crux of successful living than those who stayed focused on the challenges of material survival with its scenarios of success and failure.
