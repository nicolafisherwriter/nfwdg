## My notes

There is a triangle of content that I want to create. The three points are:

- writing
- tech
- a gentler pace (shortened to *essence* - maybe, but no-one understands that. I also like *go gently*. The *gentle* bit is hard to articulate. *Gentle* on its own makes no sense. Neither does *gentler*. I don't want *slow living* because it's not appropriate here. There's also *genius*, *self*, *daemon*. But then we're really going off at tangents. *Source* but what does that meant to most people? *Creative* and *creativity*. *Oneness*. This is the one I like the best. You've got *reconnect*, *reboot*, *realign*. For now I'm settling on *spirit*).

## Writing

Notes, thoughts, essays, logs.

## Tech

A lot about Obsidian, demystifying tech, making tech easy, making tech work. Helping others who think tech is a black art to use it more effectively.

## Spirit

Living at a gentler pace, oneness, alternative philosophy, esoteric and woo woo.
