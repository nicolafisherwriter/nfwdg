I'm not a monarchist. I used to be. I remember when Diana married Charles, and loving everything about the run up to the wedding, the day itself and the fairytale story. Of course, it wasn't. 

It was the beginning of the end of the monarchy. The mystique was gone, and the truth was starting to come out.

Some would argue that the Queen has done a sterling job for the country and I'm sure she has. But, increasingly the monarchy has become an anachronism, symbolic of members of a dysfunctional family living lavishly at the expense of their people.
