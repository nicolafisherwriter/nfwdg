Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness. Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favour all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamt would have come his way. I have learned a deep respect for one of Goethe's couplets:

Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it!

William Hutchison Murray

Life has been shifting for me recently. 

I never know why this happens. Sometimes I think it's simply an idea whose time has come. Other times, it's me being kicked in the seat of the pants.

Since April 2019 I've been travelling down a track. I thought it was taking me where I needed to be. It felt full of purpose. It felt like a mission.

I've made some progress. But it's been massively hard work. As I like to say, it's felt akin to pushing a boulder up a hill.

One step forward, several steps back.

What has always been a constant is this desire to be a Writer. Who, me? 

I realised, last night, that my social media bio has said for a while:

Writer. Photographer. Podcaster. Geek.

They were just descriptions of hobbies. Things I did in my spare time that weren't serious.

I dabbled.

I posted an article on Medium recently and it started to go a bit nuts. It inspired me massively. A small amount of validation, the knowledge that people were reading what I'd written and finding it helpful. People were taking the time to comment and tell me it had helped them.

It was a milestone. It woke me up to the realisation that if I wanted to be a Writer, I had to start owning that. I had to start living that.

For the past few years I have, in many ways, carried on the work I was doing in my last day job, albeit on a freelance basis. While I've enjoyed some of it, I allowed myself to be persuaded to take on projects that have not filled me with joy. 

In making the decision to let go of everything that doesn't fall within the writing domain, I've become fired up. Enthused. 

And it's seemed like a possiblity.

All I ever talk about is tech. My husband listens to me talk about Obsidian without having any real clue about it (he's also blind so has neer seen it). Although my analogy comparing Obsidian to a house made sense to him.

I didn't want to be a Writer because it's not a proper job. 

It's a bit creative and fluffy.
