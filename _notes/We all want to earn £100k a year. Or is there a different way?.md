## My notes

So much of my feed is about six figure incomes, £100k years, or millionaire lifestyles. Sometimes I look at the posts, check out the eCourses that promise wealth beyond your wildest dreams, and the roadmap to get you there.

Then I wonder: how do you find time? And where do you get the energy?

I'm constantly spinning plates. As are many people. 

Perhaps I just don't have that laser focus needed to earn a six figure income. Maybe my heart's not in it. 

My Dad used to call it ample sufficiency. To have enough to be comfortable and not have to worry about money. To not go without but not to be frivolous either. He was a war baby, born in 1934, evacuated as a child and subject to rations afterwards. 

There was a big thing about crushing it when I was working. One colleague was a huge fan of Gary V, and he talked constantly about how he was crushing it. 

I admit. I'm divided.

Of course, I would love to earn £100k a year or even be a millionaire. We think that this will solve all our money problems and make life easier.

I believe in abundance, the law of attraction, and that we attract into our lives based on our frequency and vibration. 

I also think that money is not everything. 

In the world we live in, unless you're off grid, we need money to survive. The utility companies, the petrol stations, the supermarkets all want to be paid for what you use.

I do think the world of money has become flawed. And I'm no financial analyst. This is an opinion.

So many of the world's natural resources are not free despite being freely available. Our world has become commoditised and commercialised.
