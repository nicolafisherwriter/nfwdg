## Highlights
Creativity has been linked to the brain, our unconscious, and our essence or innate knowing. It is this last piece, our ESSENCE, that is eternal, quantum and vast. When we speak about quantum creativity, it is our essence that is involved. As we self-actualize over time and master quantum creativity skills, we begin to tap the boundless creativity within us. — location: [965](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B098S9T8M7&location=965) ^ref-33896

We are alive now to help co-create a brand-new world and way of being that previously did not exist on Earth. To serve in this way, we are asked to go beyond the norms of past generations and bravely walk through unfamiliar terrain without a map. This takes great courage, dedication, and above all connection with our essence. — location: [969](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B098S9T8M7&location=969) ^ref-17461
