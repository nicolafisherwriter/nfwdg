title: A rocket ship exiting Earth
tags: quotes

Our spiritual evolution through Inner Work can be likened unto a rocket ship exiting Earth's gravitation field. At first it requires a lot of effort and energy to break free from the gravity of our limiting beliefs and thoughts that are self-sabotaging us trying to pull us back into their habits. But as we get through the initial phases of facing our shadows with courage we eventually break free of grip of the ego's attachments and rationalizations. Eventually the process becomes effortless and free of the gravitational pull back to limitation and ego habits because we learn to surrender every resistance that comes up. The process therefore becomes a surrender, a letting go, a turning away from the limitations of the ego that only bring suffering. Limiting themes of consciousness are no longer seductive because we see through them ~ Mat & Ash, the Yoga Couple
