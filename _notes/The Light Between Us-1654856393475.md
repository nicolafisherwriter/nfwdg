## Highlights
brilliant cords of light energy connect all of us here on earth and connect us further to our loved ones who have passed. I can see these cords of light. I can see the light between us. — location: [133](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B011H1J6EG&location=133) ^ref-399

And because the light is there, binding us, intertwining our fates, because we all draw power from the same energy source, we know something else to be true. Nobody lives a small life. No one is forgotten by the universe. All of us can greatly brighten the world. It’s just that some of us haven’t yet recognized how powerful we are. — location: [135](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B011H1J6EG&location=135) ^ref-47420
