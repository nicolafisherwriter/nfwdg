Feeling dreadful seems to unconsciously liberate me; I allow myself to let go of expectations, telling myself that it’s all pointless anyway, and I begin playing around with ideas: old ones, new ones, regurgitated ones. I start to find a sort of secret and very personal way through my darkness and then slowly come out the other side. (location: 154)
