Transcending time is one of the greatest gifts we can hope to give ourselves in our spiritual awakening. For with letting go of attachment to time comes the epitome of profound peace as the only thing that exists is now - eternally. There is no time else, and no where else other than here, now. And that is the great secret, to exist now is to exist forever. This doesn't mean to still make plans or projections for the future, it just means you are eternally present and forever seated in the eternal moment that always was, is, and always will be. In this realization comes all peace and tranquility ~ The Yoga Couple
