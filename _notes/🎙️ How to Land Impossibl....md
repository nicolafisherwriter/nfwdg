## Highlights
- 🎙️ How to land impossible podcast guests. 
  I started as a nobody.
  After 2,100+ interviews, here’s what I've learned about landing big-time guests like @bchesky, @barbaracorcoran, and @photomatt
  [THREAD] 👇🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604864231370752))
- 1. Act on motivated moments
  These are times when hard-to-reach guests are doing something new & WANT to be interviewed to spread the word.
  How do you find these moments? 
  👇👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604873320538114))
- 😽 Hang out on @ProductHunt to catch new apps and products.
  📚 Review Amazon’s upcoming books to see what’s about to get published. https://t.co/QogbpDHND8
  🔔 Turn on Twitter notifications for your dream guests. Catch what’s going on in real-time. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604875052818443))
- 2. Leverage new platforms to spark curiosity
  High-profile guests might be more likely to do a BitClout or @Racket100 interview rather than just another podcast.
  You're helping them reach a new audience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604877028306945))
- 3. Partner with well-known outlets
  Early on, I partnered with Mashable to do interviews with Seth Godin and Tim Ferriss. I also made sure I could post them on my podcast. 
  If you don't have a reputation yet, partner with people who do. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604880614383616))
- 4. Shrink your world
  Focus on smaller communities and their members. 
  This is how you find tomorrow's superstars before they blow up. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604908414222347))
- I did this with Hacker News when I first started, conducting interviews WITH members, FOR members.
  Today, look for communities like Ship30for30, OnDeck, or groups on Discourse, Reddit, or Twitter. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604912616968199))
- 5. Get referrals from your guests
  Never leave a conversation without an introduction for your next interview. 
  In early Mixergy episodes, you can hear me do this at the end of interviews while still recording. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604916345655304))
- 6. Follow up more than anyone else. 
  People say 'No' to new interviewers because they don’t believe you'll stick around.
  Prove them wrong by keeping yourself in their view.
  If you hear 'No,' set a reminder to follow up in two months. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604918455480321))
- 7. Ask for audience suggestions
  I have a "Suggest an Interview" form on my website. Many of our best guests have come from that link. 
  Your audience wants to support you. Plus, guests love to hear that they're a fan favorite. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604920149893127))
- In summary, here's how to land impossible guests: 
  1. Act on Motivated Moments.
  2. Leverage new platforms
  3. Partner with well-known outlets
  4. Tap into niche communities
  5. Get referrals from guests
  6. Follow up more than anyone else
  7. Ask audience suggestions ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner/status/1435604922146361352))
- Now I'm curious... who is your dream podcast guest?
