I've dabbled with writing for decades. But I never dreamed of calling myself a writer. I was simply someone who journaled - mostly because I couldn't resist notebooks and fountain pens. For a while, I wrote morning pages.

I was a prolific letter writer. I loved snail mail - both the sending and receiving of it. A couple of my articles were published in magazines during my thirties, and I self-published a small book.

I wasn't a writer. Writing was something other people did, not someone who only got B- for their English homework.

## The gamechanger app

I didn't think I would ever pursue writing seriously, until I came across, first, Obsidian, and, then, David Perell.

The reasons why I didn't share my writing can be summarised as follows:

1. I had nothing original to contribute - it had all been said before and more eloquently than I possibly could.
2. Although I'd filled countless notebooks, the words were for my eyes only, and the deep, dark secrets were not for public consumption.
3. I rapidly ran out of ideas.

## What I used to do

My writing always started with a blank page or a blank screen. Invariably, what appeared on either of those was rubbish. Or, as Anne Lamott calls it, the shitty first draft. But I hadn't read any Lamott back then or knew what was normal. Much of this was pre-internet, a distinctly analogue era.

Hours would pass by, wasted, with nothing to show for my time, or what I wrote would be first class drivel. Destined only for the shredder.

One of my greatest challenges was what I described as a lack of joined up thinking. A belief that I should have something more, something of greater substance, backed up with stats and empirical evidence. 

I most often had none of these. I just had ideas and possibilities.

Sometimes I would Google and find articles I could reference but it was massively time consuming and often hit and miss.

Additionally, I was acquiring piles of notebooks that ended up gathering dust and never being referred to again. On the rare occasion when I did pull down a notebook from a shelf, there were some hidden gems in there that always astounded me.

There was no real cataloguing or indexing solution back then but there is now.

## A temporary solution

I first tried Evernote back in 2009. And I loved it for a long time. But, after an initial flurry of enthusiasm, my writing would fade away and Evernote simply became a repository of random notes.

The same happened with Bear. I loved Bear too. 

I didn't know it then, but there were no real links between notes.

Which meant making connections in my head that much harder too.

I needed something that would help me join the dots but Obsidian wasn't even an idea back then.

## Obsidian was a game changer

From the first days of coming across Obsidian in April this year, it felt akin to discovering the holy grail. On a daily basis I regaled my husband with tales of new plugins, new discoveries, new methods that I'd come across in the Discord community and on YouTube. I loved the potential of Obsidian so much that I would often wake up in the middle of the night with an idea that I wanted to implement straightaway.

As soon as I came across Obsidian and began to get to grips with it, I realised this was what had been missing. Using Obsidian matched the way my head worked. It revolutionised the way I compiled my writing. I'd tried tools like Scrivener but it never lit a fire beneath me in the same way.

You can make Obsidian your own. It works with and without folders, and can be as complex or as simple as you like. It reminds me of the early days of the internet when blogs relied on links and backlinks, taking you down rabbit hole after rabbit hole. I can now create the same effect with my own personal wiki.

I quickly picked up on the idea of digital gardens and started cultivating my own. Using Obsidian Publish, I loved that I could publish my writing and share it online. (Recently, I've migrated my blog into Obsidian too).

## Fill the bucket

Using Obsidian is an evolution. From those early, heady days of getting set up, I've reframed things a number of times and, recently, started thinking about my workflow. 

Around the same time I was reading David Perell's posts about writing which inspired me to create my own plan. I'd realised that I needed to write once and share in a variety of places but that required a process and some tracking.

In one of his webinars, David further added to my workflow by talking about writing from abundance. Instead of facing that blank screen, start with your reading.

Obsidian was already the repository for some email content, or extracts from emails. A plugin called funneled my Kindle highlights into my Vault. I captured web content using the MarkDownload Chrome extension.

But David Perell's ideas added a further layer.

I initially added Pocket to the mix but then came across Get Matter. I set up Readwise and subscribed. I now add content to Get Matter, which filters into Readwise which, in turn, synchronises with Obsidian. 

It gives me a great workflow and material that acts as a starting point for my writing.

## Books become easier

I have several book and eBook ideas on the go. In the past I would have tried to work on one at a time. It seemed sensible (and possibly still is!).

With Obsidian, I can outline a book idea in a note. I can link to existing notes for sections or chapters, and even create a note that doesn't exist yet. But it's there, accounted for, ready to be activated when I click on the link.

Each book has a separate folder. Within that folder are random notes relating to the book. When I'm ready I can collate them and order them. There's even a plugin for that!

I can also pull in blocks of information from other notes and other folders. I do this a lot with quotes and references.

## Taking note with the daily note

Although I journal, I don't have a consistent practice. It's often dependent on whether I can find a cafe where I can sit and think for a while.

The Daily Note in Obsidian is a piece of genius. A new note pops up every day. You can specify a Daily Note template. Mine has evolved over the past months and the function of my Daily Note has shifted as well. 

I'm using it more for interstitial journaling these days, logging what I did today, as well as tracking my monthly and weekly goals. It's especially useful for noting client conversations, phone calls and linking those back to individual notes.

## The genius of Obsidian

Obsidian has become the place I write, it tracks my client work, is a store for information relating to our house and daily life. It contains highlights from my Kindle books, as well as references and quotes scraped in various ways from the web. I'm sure I'm not even using Obsidian as extensively as many people do yet it's transformed the way I do so many things.

I love the way I can connect notes with backlinks and tags. The graph shows connections too.

Obsidian uses Markdown so my files are synchronised with my iCloud. I can access them from a variety of devices, and not just using Obsidian but also other tools such as iA Writer.

I love the voice recording function too. I've started using this for private podcasts on my website.

Obsidian has become an obsession. I'm probably due another dive into what's possible - I've not been tracking the active and very helpful Discord channel as much lately. 

## Writing with abundance with Obsidian

Not only is the Obsidian window conducive to writing but I can search on ideas, populate writing with references to quotes or other information. I can start my writing from abundance rather than from that blank page.

## Annotations

One of the best discoveries, thanks to David Perell's webinar, was adding my own comments and notes on my Kindle, in Get Matter and Readwise. These are all synchronised with Obsidian so that I can extract my own thinking and use that as a starting point for an article.

## Trust the process

While I was a big Evernote fan, it became mostly a repository for scanned documents and saved web articles. I did write in Evernote on occasion.

Bear was very similar. 

They just weren't Second Brains.

With Obsidian I can throw content into my PKM bucket and know that I can find it again, will be prompted through hashtags and the graphs to repurpose what I've saved.

# To folder or not to folder

I currently have two Vaults. One for A Gentle Life content, and another for my writing and personal notes. By April, I'm going to amalgamate these into one Vault.

In my notes vault, I have a Walled Garden area for notes that will never be published. The rest is for my Obsidian publish site.

I've tried a number of permutations with folders. I've used the Johnny Decimal system. I've had no folders. Now I'm back to using folders. Those that contain references, highlights and other imported content are simple folders with no hierarchy.
