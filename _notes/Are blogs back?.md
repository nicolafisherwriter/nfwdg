In 1995 when I started working for Cap Gemini, a guy called Malcolm showed me the basics of HTML. More importantly he told me how I could *view source* which ramped up the pace of my learning. For a while I had a website that looked remarkably like Amazon's! (Back in the day, of course).

That was the beginning of my love of all things internet and tech. I hand coded countless websites, I built a series of blogs mostly full of random jottings. I loved the way I could FTP files up to a site, hit refresh on my browser and those pages of code would be transformed into images and a nice layout.

I discovered domain names too. I should have counted the number of domain names I bought over the years - it's would have made quite a list!

This used to be [one of my blogs](https://www.vanillasky.co.uk/). Bought just before the film of the same name launched, I relinquished it one year in my annual domain name declutter.

This was [another](https://silverpink.co.uk/). 

Revisiting domain names is like going back to your old childhood home!

Publishing my Obsidian content is not dissimilar to those early days. Now more Markdown than HTML, there's still the same thrill of seeing a page appear in my browser. While I no longer use FTP, GitHub Desktop fulfils the same function.

I remember hours spent researching topics, clicking through one link after another, going down rabbit holes from one blog to the next. It was heady stuff!

And a dream come true. Long before I'd even heard of the internet I'd already imagined it.

I loved writing my blogs. They were all anonymous. Before the moment when everyone started using their own name as their domain. I tended towards the quirky and eclectic. I documented my days.

Fortunately Wayback Machine has saved some entries. 

I rooted through them and decided to save them on my daily log. It may take a while. 

I started looking through my weblog and found myself going down memory lane (a very different memory lane to the one my parents went back to). 

People I used to follow. People like Susannah Conway in an earlier iteration. I remember the excitement of reading a new post. Following a link that took me to another website or resource. 

I wonder where they are now. 

People like the old grey poet. 

Caterina - did she start Flickr?

Alex Beauchamp. 

Etc. 

Where are they now?

It was a different world in so many ways. The internet was still a brave new world. It was quirky and creative and ready for anything. I loved it so. 

Perhaps weâ€™re going back to those days. Maybe digital gardens are the present day blogs.
