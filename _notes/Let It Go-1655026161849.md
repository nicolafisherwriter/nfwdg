## Highlights
The first is the conviction that even in the blackest moments of despair there is hope, if one can find the courage to pursue it. Sometimes the worst is less overwhelmingly awful than we fear; sometimes the right attitude can create good even from life’s most terrible situations. — location: [339](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07M8PJ2DS&location=339) ^ref-35661
