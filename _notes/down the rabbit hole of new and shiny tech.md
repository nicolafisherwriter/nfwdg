# down the rabbit hole of new and shiny tech

I love tech. I always have. Since I first came across the internet I've thought in terms of potential and connections. Back in the day, almost 30 years ago, I spent much of my time going down endless rabbit holes of information and tools. I liked joining the dots and putting together random apps to enhance my workflow. There was always a battle to be had at work, understandably so due to security considerations, trying to get others on board with the amazing opportunities that tech could offer.

### Obsidian

Since I first came across Obsidian, I've been back down the rabbit holes. One thing has led to another and I've jumped from stepping stone to stepping stone. It's been a particularly exciting time, rich with possibilities. It brings me immense joy.

I've talked about Obsidian [elsewhere](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/obsidian/). If you use a tool like Evernote, OneNote, Bear etc, need to make connections between different pieces of information, are a writer or academic, Obsidian is a gamechanger. It's as vanilla or bespoke as you want it to be. It truly is an amazing app and, yes, I absolutely love it!

### Napkin

In the past week I've become a private beta tester for [Napkin](https://www.napkin.one/). Also about making connections between thoughts and ideas, Napkin adds another layer to what I'm doing with Obsidian and allows me to blend my own thoughts and ideas with [others](https://app.napkin.one/shared/adventures-in-life). This means that, unlike Obsidian which is _my_ second brain, Napkin lets you link up with other people's brains. I'm thrilled to be involved right in the early stages and to be able to see the app evolve over time.

### Readwise

There's another element to this tech journey. The Obsidian community mentions [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) - a lot!

> [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) is software built on top of existing reading platforms — such as Amazon Kindle, Apple iBooks, and Instapaper — that conveniently resurfaces all the things you found important while reading. This interrupts the natural process of forgetting, creating repeated opportunities to actually do something with what you've read.

Spotting [Martine Ellis](https://sleek.bio/martine)' PKM (personal knowledge management) workflow tipped me over the edge and set me off configuring Readwise in a comprehensive way. Tied in with my Twitter revival (see below), my set up is inspired by Martine.

Like her, I send noteworthy tweets to Readwise. I initially resurrected my Pocket account - but see below for an alternative that I'm beta testing. Although my Kindle highlights were already synchronised with Obsidian via a plugin, I've pulled them into Readwise too. I don't use AirrAudio that often but that may be part of my future set up.

Of course, the key to all of this is that Readwise synchronises with Obsidian. It becomes the mechanism by which the majority of my content is processed.

If you know anything about me, you'll already be aware that I like seamless processes. I've long been a fan of IFTTT and Zapier to create automations for me between various apps.

### Matter

I came across Matter this week. Also in beta, I'm on board and setting up my account. So far, so good. The interface is clean and clear. Similar but different to Pocket, Matter is for writers. Either to read what they write or to share your own work. This adds another layer to the curation of content. The audio function which reads post to you in a very natural voice is a winner.

I'm looking forward to using Matter more extensively as I develop my knowledge management process.

### Twitter

The big news, though, is that I've been diving back into Twitter! I never thought I would say that. You can [read why here](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/twitter/).

More conducive to sharing information and links than Instagram, Twitter has opened up new connections as I go down the PKM rabbit hole.

Twitter seems to be undergoing something of a renaissance or perhaps I've just caught them at a good moment. Twitter Spaces, similar to Clubhouse, has been launched, focusing on voice (which I love) but perhaps with the benefit of already having a community with which to share your space.

### Revue

Acquired by Twitter, Revue is a newsletter associated with your account. A bit like Substack you can offer free and paid for newsletters. You can add a sign up link to your profile and newsletters are shared to your timeline.

I'm using my account to share a weekly (or more frequent) round up of findings and some of my own posts.

### Racket

Another voice app! My favourite. This is like a mini podcast, a short story that you share or just 9 minutes worth of chat. Again, shared direct to your Twitter account, I find it interesting and will be exploring it further.

So, these are the new and shiny apps I'm enjoying right now. Although I am something of a magpie, I try to restrict myself to apps that can add value to my life or my content. I'm very much on the PKM journey and that's the driving force at the moment behind what is really interesting me. It is the gift that keeps on giving and I don't see the appeal of it waning any time soon!
