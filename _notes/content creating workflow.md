My favourite app of 2021 has to be [Obsidian](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/obsidian/). I can't see anything surpassing it in the second half of the year.

Although I've only been using Obsidian for a relatively short space of time, it's been a game changer. My current set up has evolved since my initial configuration and, on an almost daily basis, Chris listens to me when I tell him what tweaks I've put in place, what new plugins I've installed, or the latest and greatest integration that I've just discovered. Early on I said to him, just let me tell you what I've done, nod and say it sounds amazing! So, he does.

I could wax lyrical about Obsidian for hours. But, what I wanted to share today is how I create content.

### Johnny Decimal

I've recently implemented [the Johnny Decimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com/) for organising my folders. I resisted this initially because I also publish some of my notes and wanted to separate out my private and public folders. But several other Obsidian users shared their set up and I decided to do the same.

This is one of my folders.

**10 Projects**

These are the main areas of my work and include subfolders for my 2021 plan, a Derbyshire Year, a Gentler Pace, a Gentle Life, and the Blind Woodturner.

When I drill down to the next level, say for a Gentle Life, this is where I store my blog posts, newsletter drafts, and podcast ideas.

I've already drafted several blog posts and add to these on an ad hoc basis as ideas occur to me and then, as deadlines approach, I'll edit and finalise what I've written.

### Ghost

A very recent addition to my online presence, Ghost is my new content hub. A big favourite of the Obsidian fans, it was a rabbit hole I was going to go down sooner or later.

Yes, you can achieve the same results with WordPress, Squarespace or other blogging platforms. You can share your writing on Medium or Substack. And create a membership option via Patreon or a plugin on your website.

I just like some of the geekiness of Ghost and the ability to have my blog, newsletter and member area all under one roof.

The best bit, for me, is that I can integrate Ghost with Obsidian without the need to copy and paste. This is where iA Writer comes in.

### iA Writer

I used iA Writer on a regular basis several years ago but moved on to other tools such as Scrivener. I was delighted to discover that I could integrate iA Writer with Ghost. (You can also integrate with Medium, Micro.blog and WordPress).

Because Obsidian is a text-based app and stored locally, the text files can be opened by several other apps such as 1Writer or Text Edit.

iA Writer comes into its own once an Obsidian note is complete. I simply select the publish option, send the post to Ghost and I can then schedule or publish it.

### Dynalist

Another app created by the team that makes Obsidian, [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/) is an outliner and to do list app. While there's no integration (at least not one I've yet found) with Obsidian, Dynalist is a clean and simple to do list which integrates with Google Calendar.

It's not the cheapest to do list app but I've found it to be really effective. The ability to date tasks and see them in my calendar is crucial for me.

I keep a long to do list and then separate lists for individual clients, my quarterly plan, and our shopping list.

The quarterly plan details my annual goals, together with all my content. So, where Obsidian is the home of the actual blog posts, Dynalist is the publication schedule.

### Journals

I'm using my journals and notebooks less than I used to. Obsidian has taken their place in many instances. But I do still enjoy jotting down ideas with a favourite fountain pen.

Sometimes working with pen and paper is the only thing that will do.
