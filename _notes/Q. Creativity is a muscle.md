Creativity is like a muscle — the more often you use it, the stronger it gets, and the more you come to rely on it, even unconsciously. I believe that everyone is creative, but we have to train ourselves to be so in a comfortable and confident way. If I exercise my creativity frequently, keeping it as limber as I do my voice, I’m much more likely to make discoveries and improve my performance. That’s the real joy of performing: you do something for so long and with such discipline that it actually begins to look, and at times even feel, effortless ~ Renée Fleming, [The Inner Voice: The Making of a Singer](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=5b26ec14e7&e=eb9759f735) ^04256d
