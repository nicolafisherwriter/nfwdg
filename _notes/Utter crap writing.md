### “So, I do a lot of writing then I say, “Okay, I know what I’m writing today is utter crap. I’m just going to keep going, because this is my writing time. I only have one hour or 25 minutes. I’m going to write and if it’s crap, I’ll edit it later.” So, always telling people to just get to the end of the pages of that day or the pages of that month, where the end of the book and worry about editing it later.  
  
It’s like parenting, right? Half of parenting is just showing up. Writing is like that, too. I’m never going to be Tolstoy, but I can be the best me writer by just showing up and showing up and showing.”
