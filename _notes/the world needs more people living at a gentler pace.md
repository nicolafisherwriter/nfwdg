> Donâ€™t ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go and do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive ~ Howard Thurman

For much of my career, I didn't feel very alive! I worked because I needed to, and I had little idea what other options might exist.

I felt there must be more to life.

## At first you catch glimpses

At weekends I spent hours walking around the local park with my camera. It was there that I started to change my thinking. Here's what helped.

-   Spending time outside, noticing the seasonal changes

-   Doing something creative which led me to experience flow

-   From flow came inspiration which poured out into my journals

-   Being alone and recharging my batteries

The process was gradual but, over 15 years I clocked up the miles in the park. My notebooks filled up, and my creative well was replenished.

I reconnected with my self. Here's how you can too:

## Step 1: Leave expectations behind

This is an organic process. It takes as long as it takes.

I had no idea what was unfolding but, gradually, the lightbulb moments increased and started to show me the way.

## Step 2: Be in nature

Walking outside isn't just a breath of fresh air, it helps us recharge and reconnect. Over time we have lost much of our connection with nature. It is hugely important.

## Step 3: Be creative

Photography was my catalyst to find flow. What's yours?

Writing down my observations in my notebooks was also key - years later I'm following the path I described in my journaling!
