## Highlights
I’m always taken by surprise at how unintentionally creative I start to become during a time of despondency. Feeling dreadful seems to unconsciously liberate me; I allow myself to let go of expectations, telling myself that it’s all pointless anyway, and I begin playing around with ideas: old ones, new ones, regurgitated ones. I start to find a sort of secret and very personal way through my darkness and then slowly come out the other side. — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GBHQC9W&location=154) ^ref-3852

The internet may be able to keep on giving us more and more ‘stuff’ ad infinitum, but our brains don’t function like that. Our brains function in a much slower way, and connecting to our creative side involves inhabiting time in a capacity that is at odds with our standard perception of how we think it flows. — location: [308](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07GBHQC9W&location=308) ^ref-58447
