  - > Then these words from The Biology of Transcendence by Joseph Chilton Pearce leapt off the page and sent chills up my arms: “Transcendence, the ability to rise, and go beyond limitation and restraint, is our biological birthright, built into us genetically and blocked by enculturation…. Once we have been faithful in small works by which we learn to trust the life process, larger and larger works become possible.” (location: 169)
