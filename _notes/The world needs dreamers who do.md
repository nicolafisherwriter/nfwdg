### “You can’t afford to think about how the work will be received when you’re finished.  
That’s not your job....  
It can’t be published, produced, performed, or purchased if it doesn’t exist.  
Dare yourself to believe in your creativity, wherever it may lead you.  
Trust that where it leads is exactly where you’re supposed to be."  
.....  
The world needs dreamers and the world needs doers  
But above all,  
The world needs dreamers who do.”
