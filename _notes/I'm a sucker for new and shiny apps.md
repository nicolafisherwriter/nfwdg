# I'm a sucker for new and shiny apps

I’m glad I’m not alone in my quest for the perfect productivity app. From what I read, our numbers are legion.

Spoiler alert: the perfect app does not exist. I’ve tried most of them.

I wish I could resist the new and shiny but then along comes the *best to do app* yet. *It changed my life*.

This year I’ve used Dynalist. That was in my minimalist phase. A great app, created by the makers of Obsidian.

But after some time my productivity dipped. I went back to Things 3 and dallied with ClickUp.

Next was the return of Tick Tick. A bit of pink after the more austere Things.

But still the same issue remained. The app wasn’t helping me get things done.

Then I find myself handwriting my to do list. Somehow, seeing my tasks on paper calms my overwhelmed brain in a way that an app never does.

I love the immediacy of logging ad hoc actions on an app. But then they fester.

Clearly the common denominator is me.

### But what stops our apps working for us?

Ironically, it’s when I’m at my busiest that things go awry. I don’t check the app. I miss actions. Then I break the streak. And that, for me, is a stumbling block.

In that I recognise my perfectionist tendencies. And my procrastination. Often the true crux of the matter.

Until we address our tendency to put off today what can wait for tomorrow, no app can ever save us. Even though I still wish it would!
