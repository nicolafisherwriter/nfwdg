## Highlights
- Are you sensitive to noise and struggle to concentrate?
  Me too.
  I finally found a solution... and it's probably not what you think.

- Noise sensitivity makes it hard to focus. 
  It is not so much the volume - it is the type of noise. 
  If people are talking, I tune in. If there‚Äôs music, I listen (and sing!) If someone is eating an apple in another room, things get really bad‚Ä¶ can you relate?

- Previously, my most effective concentration strategy was to use in-ear headphones and listen to white noise (I ‚ù§Ô∏è @DarkNoiseApp). 
  This works well until someone needs your attention. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1444392284989149184))
- I replaced my in-ear headphones with over-ear ones, and this worked far better. 
  The trouble with large headphones, though, is they are not terribly comfortable. 
  And, annoyingly, people still take you by surprise üò≥ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1444392287111454723))
- Thankfully, I discovered Loop earplugs. Loop offers a range of noise reducing and cancelling earplugs that look smart...
  I got these: https://t.co/82lYINZULo (affiliate link 'cos I LOVE THEM SO MUCH!)

- I do not understand how they work, but they reduce background noise significantly, but if someone raises their voice behind me, I can hear it. 
  Game-changer üí• ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1444392299576844300))
- The reduction in background noise is enough to allow me to concentrate while still being aware of significant, attention requiring sounds.
  I am so much more productive when I wear them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1444392307466330119))
- TLDR:
  Loop earplugs are an amazing productivity tool for noise-sensitive people who struggle to concentrate.
