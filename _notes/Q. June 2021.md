June can be a powerful force for change if we do not keep knocking at the door that has closed and instead, create a new door of opportunity for ourselves. We can restructure, rebuild, renew, reboot, and refresh our lives in any way we wish. All we have to do is to avoid the temptation of not seeing what is in front of us because we do not like the view or wish things were different and instead, move beyond our limiting beliefs, grief, sorrow, and regret about the past and use it to create a more joyful, joy-filled present and future ~ Jennifer Hoffman
