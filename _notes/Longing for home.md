Everyone at some point finds themselves in the ashes of life and longs for home. The real home turns out to be the center within each life and each return to that inner core not only calms us, heals us and makes us whole, but also adds some healing and wholeness to the world around us. When the end seems near, it becomes time to seek the center within and find ways to be central to the healing of the scorched and scarred earth around us. The great tragedies and dramas of life and the threat of it all ending try to return humanity to an awareness of the eternal presence of the divine waiting at the center of each life and all of life ~ Michael Meade
