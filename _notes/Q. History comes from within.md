Another old idea suggests that history is not something coming from outside ourselves that simply defines who we become. Rather, history is made in the depths of the individual soul. In that sense, the point behind the current loss of truth and social unity may be a collective calling to awaken the deeper sense of self within us all ~ Michael Meade
