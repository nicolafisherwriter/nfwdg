My voyage of discovery with Obsidian has been incremental. I've peeled back the layers one day at a time. In recent weeks as I've prioritised my writing, taken on board insights from David Perell and Nicolas Cole, I've streamlined my processes to make the most of the time I have available, and to get the best traction from my content creation. 

## it all starts with Obsidian

I've just reorganised my Obsidian folders putting some previously public notes into my Walled Garden and developing a better structure for items in my Digital Garden.

This has made it much easier to have Obsidian as my sole mechanism for writing.

## data input

I save quotes, web articles, useful emails and newsletters to [Matter](https://getmatter.app/). There I can highlight and annotate.

These references are automatically synced to [Readwise](https://readwise.io/), together with my Kindle highlights and notes. From there these sync to Obsidian.

## percolation

Once notes arrive in Obsidian, I can then add tags, extract the notes I've made, and use blocks of text in articles. This process is based on David Perell's concept of writing from abundance. Instead of facing the blank page, you piggy back on to your reading, other people's ideas and your own thoughts about those ideas. You become a creator rather than merely a consumer.

## idea bank

Each idea can become a standalone note or be aggregated by tag as part of a theme. Simply tagging notes as #idea #atomicessay quickly highlights potential new articles.

## Nicola's notes

Once a note is ready to ship, it's added first to [Typeshare](https://typeshare.co/) and published on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/liveagentlelife). I may use the hashtag [#tweet100](https://tweet100.com/).

Using iA Writer, notes can be created as drafts on both [Ghost](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/) and [Medium](https://liveagentlelife.medium.com/). 

Already created in Obsidian, and using [Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish), new notes appear as part of [Nicola's Notes](https://nicolasnotes.co.uk/).
