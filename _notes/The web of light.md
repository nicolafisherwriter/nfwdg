As many more Starseeds integrate their light codes and star knowledge, they increase their connection with the web of light.

Their thoughts and intentions upgrade the matrix of whole grid, including those linked to other star systems. This accelerates and enhances their remembering process.

Many collective consciousness grids are running parallel to each other and sometimes overlapping around the Earth. Starseeds share and co-fabricate their own grid of consciousness.

The Starseed consciousness grid is a web of light and frequency that makes up the consciousness that connects all Starseeds.

This grid facilitates the pouring of light consciousness into the cracks of the existing matrix to develop ascended consciousness. This light grid system is also like a cloud communication system for them to access.

Lightcodes allows Starseeds to upload individual keycodes to anchor the light on Earth. It’s an encoding of star genomes, for the planet to operate harmoniously.

The Starseed consciousness grid operates on higher wave-length and frequency. Therefore, accessing the Starseed consciousness grid requires that the Starseed is awakened.

An awakened Starseed is a star being wrapped in human flesh, who has activated the necessary (100% is not required) lightcodes dormant in their DNA.

Starseeds keycodes activate on their own as their consciousness raises. Acceleration can happen once activated. This takes place parallel to their spiritual awakening. They will remember their true origins.

Not every Starseed awakens and becomes an integrated multidimensional being. Just like anyone else, Starseeds too have to unplug themselves from disempowering timelines and actualize their sovereignty.

Before Starseeds awaken, their oscillations will increase to higher octaves of light. Sometimes Starseeds can accidentally tap into this higher grid when their energy is high and not realize it.

Starseeds can consciously strengthen the grid by upload healing and empowering codes for others. They do this by unplugging from artificial timelines and matrices.

This web of light to can also be used to communicate with other Starseeds telepathically. The grid can be used to infuse their soul’s prayers for humanity, manifest their visions for the future, or contact other star systems.

It’s time for all Starseeds, lightworkers, and visionaries to step into their spiritual power. You don’t have your dreams on accident and things don't happen by chance. These words don't always resonate with everyone. If this resonates with you, this is your calling.
