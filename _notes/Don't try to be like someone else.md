## My notes

Sometimes I look at things others are doing and think that it would be a great idea to do the same. I admire others who have succeeded in their field and wonder whether I could as well.

But I'm not them. We're all different and I'm especially quirky. Yet even now, at 58, I'm still not owning who I really am. I feel a sense of lack, not good enough, not right enough. I look at others and believe they are more ‘right’ than me.

But I am alright as I am.

Finding your voice in writing and in any other context is about being yourself. It's about finding your truth. It comes back, again, to reconnecting with your essence. Everything comes back to the same place. Whatever it is we're doing, to succeed at it, we need to live our truth.

Be who you really are, not a figment of your imagination. We need to be our glorious selves not a facsimile.

We water ourselves down, we focus on inconsequential stuff. We don't go all in. We don't put our heart and soul into it. 

> You gotta commit. You've gotta go out there and improvise and you've gotta be completely unafraid to die. You've got to be able to take a chance to die. And you have to die lots. You have to die all the time. Bill Murray
