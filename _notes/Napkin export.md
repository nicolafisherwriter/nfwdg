I have a vision of a world where we naturally connect to our essence, and where we each play a part in transforming our lives on this planet.

Essence is our individual signature, a combination of what we love and cherish, our passions and interests, our strengths and talents. Completely one of a kind, essence is our philosopher’s stone. We can only find it by looking within.

Finding out who we are, understanding what bring us joy and purpose, and connecting with our essence are the keys that align us with the core essence of the natural world.

Rather than the need to heroically save the whole world, the real work of humanity at this time may be to awaken the unique spark and inner resiliency of genius within each person.

The wound in one person can become the door through which everyone can find the centre of life again.

When you are connected to your passion, your heart is free. Joy flows through you like an open tap. You can feel it, the serene certainty of your purpose coursing through you like a current. This is what you are meant for. Here is your gift, the medicine that will heal you and help you heal the world.

Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read those lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe in our own powers, our own criterion of truth and beauty. Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. We all derive from the same source. There is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part of creation, all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up, only to discover what is already there.

At this critical time on earth, the real work of humanity may depend upon finding a greater sense of meaning and truth within ourselves that can connect us to the underlying wholeness and hidden unity of all of life.<br>

There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. You do not even have to believe in yourself or your work. You have to keep yourself open and aware to the urges that motivate you. Keep the channel open.

When we resist our lives, we create greater separation from the truth of who we really are. The more separate we feel from our true Self of love and joy, the more powerless we feel, and the more powerless we feel, the more we suffer. We are inviting you to demonstrate your love for yourself by waking up to your own power. Accept that no one and no thing outside of yourself can ever steal your peace or your joy ever again. It’s not about what has happened to you, it is how you decide to respond that determines the quality of your life. This is your life, and only you are in control of how it is experienced. Although it may be uncomfortable at first, the truth will set you free.

Everyone at some point finds themselves in the ashes of life and longs for home. The real home turns out to be the center within each life and each return to that inner core not only calms us, heals us and makes us whole, but also adds some healing and wholeness to the world around us. When the end seems near, it becomes time to seek the center within and find ways to be central to the healing of the scorched and scarred earth around us. The great tragedies and dramas of life and the threat of it all ending try to return humanity to an awareness of the eternal presence of the divine waiting at the center of each life and all of life.

Soul would have us go where we fear to go in order to learn who we are intended to be.

Rather than the need to heroically save the whole world, the real work of humanity at this time may be to awaken the unique spark and inner resiliency of genius within each person.
