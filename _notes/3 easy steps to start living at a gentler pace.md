I prioritised work for many years. But I missed out on other aspects of life. 

I would often burn out. I didn't want to wake up one day to find there was no time left to follow my bliss.

Unfortunately, this is the story for many people. They never find time to slow down and smell the roses until it's too late.

## Living at a gentler pace requires discipline

It's very easy to default to our comfort zone. We often think:

-   It's not important
-   There's always tomorrow
-   I have to pay my bills
-   I don't have time

We might not be able to live a gentle life 100% of the time but we can carve out some time every day for ourselves.

## Step 1: Evaluate your inputs

Often it's our inputs that determine our outputs. Seek out the positive in all things.

Think in terms of the type of food you eat, the content you read, watch and listen to.

## Step 2: Let go

Declutter physical stuff that you don't need. Release your attachments.

Walk every day in nature, even if it's just for five minutes and mentally let go.

## Step 3: Prioritise what's important

Focus on what's truly important, what brings you joy, and the rest will follow naturally.

Just for today, don't worry about the small things. Sit quietly, relax or meditate.

When you begin to embrace the gentle life, doors will start to open.

The steps to living at a gentler pace are simple. Often we make the implementation difficult. Try just one thing a day for a week and see what happens.

Take it one day at a time.
