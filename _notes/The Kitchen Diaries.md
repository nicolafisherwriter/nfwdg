Christmas cake butter – 250g light muscovado sugar – 125g dark muscovado sugar – 125g dried fruits – prunes, apricots, figs, candied peel, glacé cherries, 650g in total large free-range eggs – 3 ground almonds – 65g shelled hazelnuts – 100g raisins, sultanas, currants, cranberries – 350g in total brandy – 3 tablespoons, plus extra to ‘feed’ the cake the zest and juice of an orange the zest of a lemon baking powder – ½ teaspoon plain flour – 250g You will need a deep 20cm cake tin with a removable base, fully lined with a double layer of lightly buttered greaseproof paper or baking parchment, which should come at least 5cm above the top of the tin. Set the oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Beat the butter and sugars till light and fluffy. I needn’t tell you this is much easier with an electric mixer, though I have done it by hand. Don’t forget to push the mixture down the sides of the bowl from time to time with a spatula. While the butter and sugars are beating to a cappuccino-coloured fluff, cut the dried fruits into small pieces, removing the hard stalks from the figs. Add the eggs to the mixture one at a time – it will curdle but don’t worry – then slowly mix in the ground almonds, hazelnuts, all the dried fruit, the brandy and the citrus zest and juice. Now mix the baking powder and flour together and fold them lightly into the mix. Scrape the mixture into the prepared tin, smoothing the top gently, and put it in the oven. Leave it for an hour, then, without opening the oven door, turn the heat down to 150°C/Gas 2 and continue cooking for one and a half hours. Check whether the cake is done by inserting a skewer – a knitting needle will do – into the centre. It should come out with just a few crumbs attached but no trace of raw cake mixture. Take the cake out of the oven and leave to cool before removing it from the tin. Feed the cake by pouring brandy into it every week until Christmas. Spike the cake with a skewer and drizzle in some brandy. Cover tightly and leave in a cake tin till needed. It will keep for several weeks. — location: [5777](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B00AP963HA&location=5777)Christmas Cake Recipe
