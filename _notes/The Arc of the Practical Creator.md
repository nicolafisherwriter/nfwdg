## Highlights
* It’s as if creative expression is useful for its ability to create connections between young neurons, and once that purpose has been fulfilled, it becomes an obstacle that gets in the way of viable career paths. With this view, the arts are utilitarian at best, burdensome at worst.
  * **Note**: This is why we struggle to pursue creative careers.
* Creativity has more to do with the authentic desire to express, and less to do with the art form itself.
* An act of expression can only be deemed creative when it is aligned with one’s true curiosities and interests.
