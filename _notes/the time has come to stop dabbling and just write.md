title: the time has come to stop dabbling and just write

When I was 21, living in Paris and absorbing the writing culture by osmosis, I dabbled with the idea of being a writer.

My landlady wrote for Madame Figaro, a friend was working on the great American novel (although he didn't rate my writing), and I spent a small fortune on books in the librairies.

It was freezing that Winter but I remember writing in cafes, an espresso and Gibert Jeune journal to hand. Then, as now, I loved the act of writing.

I felt a kinship with all those Paris residents who had gone before me. My writing was just a hobby, nothing serious, occupying my spare time. Publication was a pie in the sky aspiration.

Back in the UK, I discovered a quirky, satirical voice. An article about pens appeared in a small print magazine. I self-published a book in my thirties and then ... nothing.

Work took over, writing was limited to journaling. I wrote often but made no progress.

In 2019 I left my day job in search of a different way of life. I found a writer's website. I wanted to be like them.

For two years I was still a dabbler. I tried to find my own, different way. And then I came full circle. I wanted to create my own version of that writing life, to find a way to write more and be published.

At this point, I signed up for Ship 30 for 30. Looking back, I can clearly see the roots of my long held dream. Now it's time to take my writing seriously and stop dancing around the handbags.
