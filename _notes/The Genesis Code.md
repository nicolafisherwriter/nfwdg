These awakening individuals, if truly paying attention to their lives and not deferring to authorities about their inner nature, discover the meaning of repentance and atonement. They realize that being fully honest with themselves about the facets of self-absorption is repentance. Repentance means admitting where we feel shame, blame, guilt, and arrogance. Repentance means noticing and correcting the mind when it moralizes about ourselves, others, or the Universe. Through sustained awareness, those individuals stop or at least lessen the habits of labeling, condemning, cursing, and moralizing. — location: [1953](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09K5Y8QLS&location=1953)

CHAPTER 13 ― Vibrant Silence Exercise Practicing vibrant silence in your daily life can reveal a sense of the ever-present moment that can be tremendously transformational in your life. The key is pausing to experience the vibrant presence of the moment and noticing what prevents you from fully entering that experience. If you work to correct the blockages while practicing vibrant silence, over time, the experience becomes more accessible. Eventually your life becomes the conscious embodiment of vibrant presence. — location: [2066](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B09K5Y8QLS&location=2066)
