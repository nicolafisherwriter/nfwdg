2021 has been a year of writing, note taking and PKM (Personal Knowledge Management).

Driven by my discovery of Obsidian in April, Iâ€™ve leapt from one stepping stone to another. The latest of these is Ship 30 for 30.

Before April, I would have been less well equipped but my deep dive into the concept of a Second Brain has introduced me to writing with abundance (thanks David Perell), finding inspiration for my own writing in my reading, and using Obsidian as the repository for it all.

The note taking community even led me back to Twitter, abandoned for the first time since 2008 when I ruthlessly deleted my accounts last year. A reframe and conscious curation introduced me to like-minded people talking about topics that fascinated me.

Somewhere in that mix I found Ship 30 for 30. Keen to get started, I gleaned enough to write some atomic essays of my own. It was good practice.

For the next 30 days Iâ€™ll be writing about living a gentle life, and how that leads us to our unique essence. Plus, where tech intersects all this. And, my personal favourite, how embracing a gentler pace might enable us to change the world

Using Ev Chapmanâ€™s brilliant Consumer 2 Creator Notion template, Iâ€™ve devised a plan which will take us, one day at a time, through each of the topics and bring us to their logical conclusion.

Iâ€™m excited to get writing! Hope youâ€™ll join me for the ride!
