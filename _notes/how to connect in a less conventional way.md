<p>I&#8217;m not a natural when it comes to networking. There are days even now when my social skills are below par and networking is too much of an ask. But, generally, I&#8217;m so much better than I once was.</p>



<p>There was a time when networking would fill me with trepidation. I hadn&#8217;t appreciated, at that point, how challenging it could be to network as an introvert.</p>



<p>Fast forward several years and networking became my bread and butter, and the way I sourced the vast majority of my clients. It only started to work for me when I did it my way.</p>



<p>Eventually I devised a strategy.</p>



<p>Where people would launch into a conversation with an opening gambit of, so, what do you do?, I would look for an interesting detail like a woman with pink hair, a man with a funny tie and compliment them or comment. Then I would find out that the tie had been a Christmas gift from the man&#8217;s daughter or that the woman with the colourful hair had a collection of rainbow coloured dyes at home. I tried to find areas of common interest. I would chat to the man or woman standing alone on the periphery and find out more about them.</p>



<p>You&#8217;re dead to me</p>



<p>I would avoid the professional networkers who would abandon you as soon as they worked out you were of no use to them.</p>



<p>My network is your network</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t expect immediate results.</p>



<p>Build connections</p>



<p>You need to do the same on LinkedIn. Recently, I&#8217;ve had a flurry of messages from people offering me &#8230;</p>



<p>I had two separate messages from people wanting to make sure I never missed a client call again.</p>



<p>Another who wanted to connect because LinkedIn said he should. Who was he to argue with LinkedIn. I&#8217;m glad they didn&#8217;t suggest he jump off a cliff!</p>



<p>Several wanted to build their network in Manchester despite my profile clearly showing that I now lived in Derbyshire.</p>



<p>Another offered me tax advice! I wrote back to say I was a one man band and received no further response.</p>



<p>Close the loop</p>



<p>Sometimes I think I should just ignore some of the messages but I can never bring myself to do that. I like to close the loop and not leave anyone hanging. However, once you have outgrown any potential usefulness, you may not be accorded the same courtesy.</p>



<p>I find it hard to understand that people beleive they can send one message and that they will achieve sales that way.</p>



<p>I much prefer Scott A??? approach where he recommends taking time to find common areas of interest, taking a genuine interest in the person you&#8217;re contacting.</p>



<p>No monologues please</p>



<p>I remember once attending an event at a casino. I got stuck talking to a man who worked in construction and he talked at me for ten minutes until I needed to escape. I&#8217;d lost the will to live by that point and went off to play Roulette in the empty casino. It was far more interesting that the networking.</p>



<p>Do your research</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t think any of the recent contacts had taken the time to look at my profile, my website or social media. If they had, they would have realised that I&#8217;m not a big nor a conventional business, I&#8217;m a one man band, and I manage my own social media.</p>
