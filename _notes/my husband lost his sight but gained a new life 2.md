Imagine losing your sight. Completely. Going through a hell of anxiety, depression, insomnia, hallucinations, nausea and muscle spasms for four years. Contemplating checking out.

But then turning a corner and discovering a craft called woodturning. And finding your salvation.

Then coming to the realisation that you don’t want your sight back.

This is my husband’s story.

Becoming blind took Chris on a whole new journey, one he had never imagined for himself. Now going by the moniker of the Blind Woodturner, Chris has inspired thousands with his story of hope and determination.

He travelled the length and breadth of the Hero’s Journey, emerging at the other end as one of a kind.

We would never have met if Chris had not lost his sight. You never know what life has in store for you.
