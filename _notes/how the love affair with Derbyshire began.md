My love affair with Derbyshire began one early September weekend. Already Autumnal, I drove from Manchester towards Buxton with no idea that this visit would change my life. A work colleague had booked a stay in a converted barn in a tiny hamlet called Wormhill. She invited me over for the day.

As I parked the car hens milled about, pecking at the floor. On the other side of the single road through the village, sounds of activity came from a farm. Apart from that, all was quiet.

Inside, my friend was pottering about in a typical farmhouse kitchen. Her husband was in the lounge, in front of the woodburning stove. We sat at the kitchen table, fresh coffee brewed and chatted. Later that afternoon, we went into Buxton for lunch and a wander.

The following year I stayed at the same barn with my Mum and Dad. I talked of how wonderful it would be to live in Wormhill. It became my secret goal. 

That week, I walked around the corner and down a track to visit, morning and afternoon, with some young cows in a field. I fell in love with them and a potential future life in the Derbyshire Dales.

But, back to reality, I had a day job and a life in Manchester. My Derbyshire dream went on a back burner. Perhaps some day. Maybe when I had retired.

Whenever I could, I popped over for a day out in Buxton, often taking in Eyam and the book shop at Brierlow Bar. A few years later, I had a brief stay in Tideswell, keeping my dream alive.

My Mum became ill and died in 2013. My Dad died two years later, around the same time that Chris, now my husband, and I became an item. We gravitated to Derbyshire, staying several times at Biggin Hall Hotel, with me saying each time, at some point, I'd love to live in Derbyshire. In 2019, about six months after I'd left my then day job, Chris responded to my perennial comment with, *well, why don't we?* So, we did!

At the end of October 2020, we completed the house sale and drove away for the last time, to begin our new life in Derbyshire. We never looked back.
