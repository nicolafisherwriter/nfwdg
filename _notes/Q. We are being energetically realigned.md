We are being energetically realigned, which is bringing to the fore aspects of life that need to be balanced. As a result, imbalance is being highlighted and we can expect to be faced with challenges that require a different approach and a different perspective. Despite uncertainties it is important that we push through challenges and learn how to engage with life from a grounded heart centred space.

This is a purposeful time where your attention and focus is being directed into the deep and unknown spaces within. You are being encouraged to connect with the energy of your heart and work with its power. You may find that old emotional trauma and pain is surfacing for healing and release. The appearance of old pain and trauma can cause you to shut down your heart in fear of being overwhelmed. Resist the impulse to shut down and recognise that as you venture away from the past clarity emerges to bring freedom from pain and suffering.
