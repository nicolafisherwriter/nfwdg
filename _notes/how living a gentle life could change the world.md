# how living a gentle life could change the world

Some time ago I came across an article about how trees communicate with each other, how there exists a tree network called the Wood Wide Web!

Each tree has a role to play in its community, providing support and sharing resources. Theirs is a network of cooperation.

> It doesn’t make evolutionary sense for trees to behave like resource-grabbing individualists. They live longest and reproduce most often in a healthy stable forest. That’s why they’ve evolved to help their neighbours ~ Suzanne Simard

We can learn a lot from trees. I believe that we need to see ourselves and the natural world around us as fellow travellers on this planet of ours, aware of the innate interconnectedness between all living things.

> We have to escape the life of commodity and replace it with the life of community. What’s going to be required is a conversion of consciousness. I call it plant consciousness ~ Richard Powers

When we live a gentle life we take a step back and slow down, which leads us to reconnect with the world around us. And to each other.

I have a vision, naive maybe, of a world where we each have what we need.

-   We coexist in community
-   We share our unique gifts
-   The seasons are our clock
-   We reconnect to the earth and ourselves
-   We find fulfilment where we least expect it

In changing our perspective to _Planet-Society-Economy_ (Ron Garan, Astronaut), we shift our focus on to the world around us. We see the symbiotic relationship between us and everything in nature.
