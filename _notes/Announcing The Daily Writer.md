"Some days are typing days, and some days are thinking days and some days are playing days and some days are deleting days and some days are wondering days and some days are walking through it days and all of those are writing days.  
  
I get asked so often how I measure progress, and for so long I counted words, until I realized how much of work was in the time spent, not in the time spent typing. Honor the process. Accept how much of writing is thinking about writing. Don’t punish yourself for doing all the work that isn’t typing.”
