## Quick Markdown Guide

This is the first paragraph.

Another paragraph, separated by a new line. This text is *italic*, **bold**, ***bold & italic***, `monospace`.

The syntax for lists is simple:

- A list item.
- Another item.
- The last one.

Here's an ordered list:

1. First item.
2. Second item.
3. Third item.

An [inline link](http://example.com).

Alternatively, you can use [reference link][ref].

## Hashtags

A hashtag is a word or a phrase prefixed with the symbol `#`, used to group related documents. You can insert as many hashtags as you want in a document: #guide #markdown.

## Task Lists

Create a list of things to do or topics to research by making a list with items marked as either `[ ]` or `[x]`:

- [ ] Task 1.
- [ ] Task 2.
- [x] A completed task.
