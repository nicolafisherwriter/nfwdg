I'm Nicola. A Writer, Photographer, Podcaster, Geek.

I live in a small village in the Peak Park area of Derbyshire with my husband, [Chris](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk/), and his Guide Dog, Bamber.

I’m an INFP. I’m unconventional, quirky, an introvert and live outside the circle. That might make me eccentric!

I have an eclectic range of interests. 

### Writing

I write about the intersection between tech and [living at a gentler pace](https://agentlerpace.co.uk). I'm exploring the premise that, if more of us lived a gentle life, reconnected to who we truly are, or our essence, as I call it, we could change the world for the better.

I'm a former business advisor turned mentor, coach and writer. I focus on guiding others to put heart and soul into their life and work.

- Founder of [A Gentler Pace](https://agentlerpace.co.uk)
- Creator of [the Essence Map](https://agentlerpace.co.uk/essencemap/)
- Author of [Live Life Gently - Change the World](https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/s/book)
- Podcaster: [Conversations Across the Pond](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/conversations-across-the-pond-with-angel-nicola/id1591943922)

### WIP

- I'm writing my book, [Live Life Gently ~ Change the World](https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/s/book) in serialised format on Substack with extra options to join a webinar and receive the PDF and workbook.
- I share my writing primarily on [Medium](https://nicolafisherwriter.medium.com/). My intention this year is to publish more widely. 
- I wrote a lot more last year once I discovered [Obsidian](https://nicolafisherwriter.medium.com/why-obsidian-is-so-great-for-writing-4b3aef4a3bf9) and the philosophy around PKM. I want to continue that trend this year.
- As well as writing essays and my book, I enjoy writing short fiction.
