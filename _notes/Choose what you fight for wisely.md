### “I once asked a very successful woman to share her secret with me. She smiled and said to me..

### ‘I started succeeding when I started leaving small fights for small fighters.  
I stopped fighting those who gossiped about me...  
I stopped fighting with my in laws...  
I stopped fighting for attention...  
I stopped fighting to meet peoples expectation of me...  
I stopped fighting for my rights with inconsiderate people..  
I stopped fighting to please everyone...  
I stopped fighting to prove they were wrong about me....  
I left such fights for those who have nothing else to fight...  
And I started fighting for  
my vision,  
my dreams,  
my ideas and  
my destiny.  
The day I gave up on small fights is the day I started becoming successful & so much more content.’  
  
Some fights are not worth your time..... Choose what you fight for wisely.”
