## Highlights
- Slowing downwards’ refers to more than simply moving slowly, it means growing down towards the roots of one’s being.
- Slowing downwards creates opportunities to dwell more deeply in one’s life, for the home we are looking for in this world is within us all along.
- The lost home that we are seeking is ourselves; it is the story we carry within our soul.
- “Pay special attention to things that bring you joy that don’t involve mind-altering substances or a lot of money. Whether it’s cooking, capoeira, the guitar, or mountain biking, interests and hobbies add texture to your personality. Being “in the zone” is happiness. You lose the sense of time, forget yourself, and feel part of something larger.”
- ― Scott Galloway, The Algebra of Happiness: Notes on the Pursuit of Success, Love, and Meaning
- How we get separated from ourselves is the question we must ask ourselves if we’re going to find our way to a reconciliation with the world.
- We have adapted ourselves to a culture that severs us from the nature around us and inside us. We treat our restlessness with distractions and painkillers because we can no longer sense the true north of soul.
