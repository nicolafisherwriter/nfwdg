One of the good things you learn from birds is that they sing, and never have I seen a bird question whether they sing beautifully or not beautifully. I think that's something to keep in mind, you know? Just sing it, and have a rock and roll attitude to it. It's like a rock and roller. He's not aiming to please, like Jeeves is trying to please Wooster, you know. Just do your thing, and then, see what happens. Don't worry too much about whether you get a big round of applause or not. That's not a rock and roll attitude. If someone throws a can of beer at you, just throw it back out at them and keep going on your electric guitar ~ Ragnar Helgi Olafsson
