At 15, Jesse was the all American boy. Good looking, the girls all had crushes on him, and the boys wanted to be his friend. He was savvy enough to understand the power he had over male and female.

He was certainly no innocent and had a number of notches on his bed post. In the Summer of 1963 he met Virginia. Not his usual brand of girl, but like all the rest she had a crush on Jesse too. Unlike the rest, she concealed it, mentioned it to no-one, not even her diary.

Instead she set her sights on Jesseâ€™s best friend, Glen.

Jesse lives a sad life.

He moved to Paris to escape small town mentality, like his son twenty years later.

He met a woman who took him for all he had.

He ended up a drunk, subsisting on ad hoc jobs, thieving until he discovered writing.

Like many before him, a lush with a talent for words.
