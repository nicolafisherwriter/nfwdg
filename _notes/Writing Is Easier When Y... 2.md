## Highlights
- Writing is easier when you have a routine.
  Here's how you can build one: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455011716202499))
- 1. Write at a set time every day
  Habits are hard to build, so consistency is your best friend when you start a new one.
  Commit to writing by putting it in your calendar. 
  During that time, you must focus on writing. No phone. No distractions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455012706054147))
- 2. Spend lots of time walking
  Walk around your neighborhood and think about the piece you're working on. Open a document in your phone that says: "Article Ideas."
  Keep your phone in your hands so you can easily capture ideas quickly and save interesting ideas that come to mind. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455013817475076))
- 3. When you get stuck, do things that increase your heart rate.
  The mind works in weird ways. When you're stuck, it helps to get away from the computer. 
  Doing things that elevate your heart rate is the best way to solve problems in your writing. Walk. Run. Lift weights. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455014970978306))
- 4. Have good conversations
  Conversations are the first draft of your thoughts.
  In any good conversation, you'll say a few things worth writing about. 
  When something resonates, make a mental note of it, and when you return to your computer, write down what you said. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455016153772032))
- 5. Write in the morning, plan at night.
  I write in the morning when I have the most energy.
  But my writing begins the night before.
  Every night, before I go to sleep, I review what I'm going to write about the next day so I can think about what I'm going to say while sleeping. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455017328103426))
- 6. Commit to a publishing routine
  Successful online writers publish ideas consistently. 
  For years, @JamesClear committed to publishing two articles per week â€” leading to 114 articles per year.
  Pick a cadence and stick to it. 
  One article per month is a good place to start. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455018930388994))
- 7. Read outside the mainstream
  Try not to read what everybody else is reading.
  To find obscure books, follow rabbit holes on Amazon and spend more time in small bookstores.
  The best ideas you discover will come from outside your industry or area of expertise. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455020264169476))
- 8. Leave a summary for yourself
  When you're done writing for the day, answer two questions for yourself at the top of the page: 
  1) What's my goal for next time?
  2) Where am I stuck?
  Doing so will make it easier to get into a flow state next time you write. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1462455527208886280))
