I first came across Instagram when Susannah Conway started talking about the app. At that point I didn't have an iPhone and Instagram, in the early days, was only available on iOS. Being able to access the amazing photos, sharing all that colour and creativity was a big driver for me to acquire an iPhone.

I suspect Instagram was one of the first apps I downloaded. It was everything I hoped for, an outlet for my own photography, a source of inspiration, and a way of finding community.

I loved Instagram for a long time.

But, at some point in the past year or so, I've fallen a bit out of love with the square photo app. Did the tide turn when Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 or later, in 2018, when the co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, departed Facebook? I'm not sure but there's been a shift somewhere along the line.

I used to love sharing photos I'd taken when Instagram was truly a photo sharing app. After a day out with my camera or my iPhone, I'd be itching to upload my favourites, document what I'd been up to or the place I'd visited.

Then, increasingly, Instagram shifted from being a personal app to a business opportunity. More and more people (me included) used it as a tool to promote their offers, products and services. Yet it still worked. It became fascinating to see the creative ways others would use the app to sell their wares.

There was still a sense of community. Now we followed others because they were on our wavelength or their work was useful to us.
