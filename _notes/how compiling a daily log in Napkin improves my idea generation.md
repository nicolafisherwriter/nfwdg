# how compiling a daily log in Napkin improves my idea generation

Sometimes two paths collide to create a perfect storm. This happened for me recently.

It started with [a YouTube video](https://youtu.be/GZrKgKys5mg). David Perell and Ali Abdaal chatting about writing a first book. Part way through they’re joined by [Michael Dean](https://michaeldean.site/) who shares a visual way of dragging and dropping blocks of content.

I found that intriguing and wondered if there was a tool that did that. I started to Google. Along the way I found Michael Dean’s Notion site.

And his [logloglog](https://michaeldean.site/logloglog).

#### the daily log

A series of daily stream of consciousness entries. Michael said that logging them helped him develop ideas and essays.

I was intrigued and spent the rest of the afternoon, some of the evening, and late into the night exploring Michael’s website, and pondering my own logloglog.

#### Napkin as the capture mechanism

I’ve been using [Napkin](https://medium.com/u/42ce0231aec7) for a while now as a beta tester. Described as an app that helps you _collect ideas, see connections, be inspired_, to date I’ve used Napkin as a way to save quotes, both my own and those of others. Tags allow you to see the connections between thoughts.

Recently Stacks were implemented. This is where you can deliberately group thoughts, perhaps for a book outline or a project. I’m already exploring the possibilities.

Thinking about how I might create a process for a daily log of my own, Napkin came to mind. I created a Stack, separated it into 12 months, and added a few test entries. Tagged with the date, the hashtag _dailylog_, plus any other relevant tags, I realised it would work very well.

#### the widget that makes it work

The genius of the daily logging system lies in the phone widget.

In the past, recording thoughts has always involved some friction. I needed a notebook to hand, a note taking or voice recording app. And then all those ideas would have to be reviewed later and transferred to a central system.

With Napkin, thoughts can be typed into the widget on my phone. Click Done and they’re on their way to my Napkin Inbox.

Once a day, I _take_ those thoughts when I’m logged into the Napkin app online, add URLs, tags and the date, then move each thought to the Daily Log stack.

#### friction free

It’s removed the friction of recording ideas in the moment. I don’t have to think in a linear fashion. Just log what pops into my head, add some tags and Napkin will weave its magic. At some point later, any connections between thoughts will become apparent.

And, all these thoughts fit into my PKM workflow — I can export them to Obsidian.

#### follow your curiosity

Michael Dean talks about _creating a delirious range of dots, and then connecting them after the fact_. And following his curiosity.

This is great advice for anyone who has eclectic interests. It flies in the face of finding a niche for yourself. As someone who is fascinated by very disparate topics, I can give free rein to whatever piques my curiosity.

It’s often the quirky rabbit holes that yield the best ideas.
