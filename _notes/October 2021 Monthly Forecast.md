## Highlights
* Some will reinvent themselves internally, allowing for more of their essence to come through, changing their whole outlook and experience of life.
  * **Note**: Essence looks like reinvention but itâ€™s peeling back the layers to reveal what was already there.
* We individually and collectively create crisis to push the edge to stimulate change. This can be very stressful and cause worry and anxiety about the future. Always look at a crisis situation as an opportunity for improvement. The friction in a crisis produces energy and power that can then be channeled into re-inventing and improving life. On the other side of a crisis and breakthrough is always relief, inspiration and sometimes even euphoria.
