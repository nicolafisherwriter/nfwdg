# why Obsidian is keeping me awake at night

I make no apologies for being almost evangelical about Obsidian. But it has given me a lot of sleepless nights!

Back in April when I first downloaded Obsidian and set about creating my Digital Garden, I was in awe of the depth and breadth of the app, and the sheer scale of the possibilities it promised. I read everything I could find about other people's setups, and watched every YouTube video available. The synapses were firing as I joined the dots of Obsidian's potential.

Night after night, I would lie in bed, trying to get to sleep, when one idea after another would pop into my head. The connections I could make, plugins to be tried, and templates I might set up. Some touch paper was lit, and, invariably, I'd have to get up to start implementing what was going around my head. It was the first time in a long time that I'd felt this excited about tech (but then I am a geek!).

Obsidian was all I thought - and talked - about. Every day I would tell my husband about the latest discovery I'd made - a new plugin, a different approach, another way to extend my experience. He listened even though he couldn't make head nor tail of what I was telling him.

Finally, normal sleep returned. Until recently, when my reading inspired a review of my workflow and led me to create a more systemised approach to content creation. Another revolution has taken place, and one that's waking me up again in the middle of the night!
