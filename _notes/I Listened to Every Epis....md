## Highlights
- I listened to every episode of the Tim Ferriss Show. 
  And what's buried inside his interviews with legendary minds?
  Timeless writing advice for becoming a New York Times Bestseller.
  Here are 10 frameworks distilled from 521 episodes ðŸ§µ:

- Writing is your foundational habit. 
  â€¢Â Joy
  â€¢Â Growth
  â€¢Â Fulfillment
  â€¢ Excitement
  â€¢Â Personal success
  â€¢Â Professional success
  â€¢Â Strategic planning
  â€¢ Goal-setting
  â€¢Â Podcasting
  â€¢Â Teaching
  â€¢ Coding
  â€¢ Selling
  â€¢Â Music
  Every single one of these starts with writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405130816131078))
- If you aren't yet writing, start writing anything.
  â€¢ Journaling
  â€¢Â Brain dumps
  â€¢Â Gratitude lists
  â€¢Â Morning pages
  â€¢Â Dreams and goals
  Whatever it is, you need to start freezing your thinking on paper. 
  It's only when things are out of your head you can start to analyze them. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405134398140425))
- Ruthlessly seek negative feedback.
  When getting feedback, @tferriss requests the reader highlight:
  â€¢Â Anywhere boring
  â€¢Â Anything confusing
  â€¢ Anywhere your mind starts to wander
  Then he asks two questions - what is the:
  â€¢ 10% I must keep
  â€¢Â 20% I should cut immediately ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405136474263555))
- You don't need to be an expert to write.
  Tim didn't write his books once he had it all figured out.
  He wrote them as he learned, using them as a forcing function for clear thinking. 
  And this is a timeless writing formula: write about what you wish you knew two years ago. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405139049656320))
- Write two crappy pages per day, no matter what. 
  The best writers show up every day, whether they feel like it or not.
  Most days you will write more, and most days won't be crappy. 
  And over time, this consistency leads to 
  â€¢Â Creativity
  â€¢Â Credibility
  â€¢Â Competence ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405141264154628))
- You probably should not write a book. 
  1. You should only write a book if it will be more painful *not* to write the book
  This means being okay if no one reads it. 
  2. You must make it your number one priority for a year
  Above your friends, family, health, everything. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405144124760065))
- Your writing is a function of your environment and routine. 
  When on a deadline, @tferriss tries to make every day like groundhog day.
  By eliminating decisions, he frees up all of the mental bandwidth to focus on one thing: writing.

- Great writing is rewriting.
  Two crappy pages per day are the foundation of @tferriss' writing.
  It focuses on consistency and getting raw materials out into the world.
  And over time, two crappy pages lead to endless opportunities to:
  â€¢Â Reuse
  â€¢Â Remix
  â€¢Â Revise
  â€¢Â Rewrite ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405186600394754))
- Writing is 90% taking long walks and avoiding the internet's distractions. 
  The foundation of @tferriss' creativity is taking long walks in nature. 
  And when he needs to break glass in case of emergency, he checks himself into a hotel to get away from the world's distractions. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405189456809985))
- It's not the number of people who don't get it that matters.
  It's the number of people that do. 
  Before you start writing, actively choose who you *aren't* writing for. 
  Because writing for everyone means writing for no one.
  And 100 engaged readers >> 10000 shallow readers. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/dickiebush/status/1416405191679692800))
- And that's it!
