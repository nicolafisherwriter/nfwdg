Logic dictates that we should be able to tap into the constant narrative flow our minds provide, the roaring river of words filling up our heads, and direct it out into a neat stream of organised thought so that other people can read it. Look at what we already have going for us: some level of education, which has given us control of written and spoken language; the ability to use a computer or a pencil; and an imagination that naturally turns the events of our lives into stories that are both true and false. In short, the story is in us, and all we have to do is sit there and write it down.

But it’s right about when we sit down to write that story, that things fall apart. The journey from the head to hand is perilous and lined with bodies. It is the road on which nearly everyone gets lost… Only a few of us are going to be willing to break our own hearts by trading in the living beauty of imagination for the stark disappointment of words ~ [Ann Patchett](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3D177eddff32%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C14c478ce2307426cbebd08d94c1f97d3%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637624520833731901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=DCco62iV8xgvaOyOnGfhA54Uj8nazbg13V6X9MgO2tU%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=177eddff32&e=d0baf97615.
