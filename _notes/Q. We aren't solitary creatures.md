We aren’t solitary creatures, we don’t exist in isolation, and we don’t have to be solo artists. Each of us has a voice, and those voices, when combined, can form a chorus of thought, of feeling, even of love that has the potential to change the world. Every writer, in their own small way, can play a part in a larger anthem. It may be harmonious or discordant. It may convey hope or despair. It may evoke joy or sadness. But the more voices that are added, the more powerful, the more significant and, ideally, the more beautiful the song becomes ~ Donald R.
