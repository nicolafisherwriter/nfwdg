"Look at your grandparents: Odds are pretty good they were makers. Go back far enough and you will find people who were not consumers, people who were not sitting around passively waiting for stuff to happen to them."⁠⁠⁠⁠This is a quote from Elizabeth Gilbert's Big Magic - one of my most re-read/re-listened to books.⁠⁠⁠⁠Life has moved so fast that I actually don't think we have to go back far to find a lot of what we are missing.⁠⁠⁠⁠A generation of two maybe, maybe less, maybe just to a time before one click buying.

We are heading to the edge of the cliff. Like lemmings we’re going to go over that edge.

Our world is becoming increasingly unsustainable. People are choosing whether to eat or heat. 

The next chapter in the build back better playbook is war. We’re done with the pandemic now, although that can still be pulled out of mothballing if needed. But, for now, war is the game we’re playing. It’s a brutal game with deaths on either side, fear mongering, wars and talk of wars. 

I stopped watching the news years ago and television altogether a few years ago. I have no idea what the messaging says but I can guess. It’s aim always to put the populace in a state of fear. 

I vacillate between two points of view. One, that a lot of what is portrayed on screen is play acting, and two, it’s real and people are being killed. 

I find it all incomprehensible. That in this so called technological age, we haven’t learned that war is futile. We still haven’t learned to play nice and see each other as part of a bigger whole. 

I’m in two minds about climate change. Is it part of a natural evolution and cycle. Or has it been exacerbated by man? 

Capitalism is killing the planet, one way or another. 

There are predictions from many different factions that there will be blackouts. No electricity. No food in the shops. Stock up now, prepare. Are they right? Who knows? But, if that’s where we’re heading, imagine.

No electricity. No internet, no mobile phones. No television, radio, news. 

We would need to rely on our local communities. Become part of something else.
