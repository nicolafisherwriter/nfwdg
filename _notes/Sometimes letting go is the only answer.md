I had a feeling that something was *off* for a while. This person whose work I'd admired and supported for so long no longer reciprocated, no longer engaged with me. Our email exchanges ground to a halt. Attempts to connect fell on stony ground. Any response felt hard won. Nevertheless I continued to cheer them on and follow their work.

But, there comes a time when you have to walk away. 

It could be coincidental but everything I started doing, soon after, they did too. 

Each time I came across their work, it felt like a little kick in the stomach. My patronage was no longer valued. Why did I continue to support them?

Finally, I muted them on every platform, turned off notifications, and deleted old emails. As Chris often says, *learn, break away, transcend*. 

I've seen it before when two people have been travelling on parallel paths. Sooner or later, you have to part ways, and do your own thing. That's what I've had to do now.
