Yes, I am a magpie, drawn in by the new and shiny thing. Lately, Craft has been mentioned several times in recent posts about PKM so I thought I'd investigate.

## It's very WYSIWYG

For newcomers to PKM or the idea of tools like Roam or Obsidian, Craft could be a great starting point. You can be up and running within minutes.

## Publishing is easy

I'm loving the whole create in public concept. Craft makes it simple to do, providing a URL for each note which can be toggled on or off making it private or public. You choose.

## A clean interface

The screen is uncluttered making for distraction free writing. By simply using @ you can link to other pages. Changing fonts and formatting is intuitive too.

## Unsplash images

I'm a sucker for adding images to my writing. Craft makes it as easy as Medium, with an interface to Unsplash. Just search for what you want and hey presto, it's there.

## It's just temporary!

I'm not abandoning Obsidian! Craft and Obsidian are apples and oranges. But, for now, I'm just using Craft to publish my fiction and creative writing. I bought a domain and pointed it at my index page.

At this stage, using Craft is an experiment. The free version only allows you to create 1000 blocks. When I run out of blocks (fairly soon as I'm currently at 519), it will be easy to migrate my notes into Obsidian and re-point my domain name.

Craft is currently Apple only and the subscription version costs Â£44.99/year.
