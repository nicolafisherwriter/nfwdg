### “The interesting thing, in my experience, is that the result of \[my\] laborious and slightly obsessive \[writing\] process is a story that is better than I am in “real life” – funnier, kinder, less full of crap, more empathetic, with a clearer sense of virtue, both wiser and more entertaining. And what a pleasure that is; to be, on the page, less of a dope than usual.”
