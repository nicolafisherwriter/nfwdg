# In Brief

-   The Facts:
    
    In November of 1977, a news broadcast airing in multiple parts of England was "hacked" and interrupted with a message from a supposed extraterrestrial. How this was done or by who still remains a mystery, but it did indeed happen.
    
-   Reflect On:
    
    Are there concepts about our reality we have trouble exploring simply because it conflicts with what we've been made to believe for so many years? Why are some possibilities instantaneously rejected by us and hard for our mind to entertain?

Take a moment and breathe. Place your hand over your chest area, near your heart. Breathe slowly into the area for about a minute, focusing on a sense of ease entering your mind and body. [Click here](https://www.collective-evolution.com/coherence-conscious-media/) to learn why we suggest this.

**What Happened:** On November 26th 1977 there was a broadcast (Television) interruption in parts of South, South-east and South-west England. Southern Television was the licence holder for the service, and it was headquartered in Southampton and Dover and broadcast from the transmitters at Dover, Bluebell Hill and Hannington, among others.

A popular [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhNriwaMTQE&fbclid=IwAR2E2j_NVN2lRA5flajLxaXVwvj-_hPmcZSOK6_i2c1twg8rrvfykwoSTG4) that can be found all over the internet today shows Southern TV’s news anchor Andrew Gardner relaying the day’s news when all of a sudden, the TV’s of those who were watching went blurry and wobbly, and the broadcast was replaced by a distorted voice that delivered a message for approximately six minutes.

The event caused a panic, it was widely reported in newspapers in multiple countries, mostly in the United Kingdom and the United States.

What I find interesting about this case is that it’s never been solved. It’s simply been assumed that the station was ‘hacked’ and this was some sort of prank. I think to myself, how hard would something like this be to pull off in 1977? It must have not been an easy feat in that time given the fact that technology wasn’t very advanced, it’s not like it could have been done in a few minutes with a laptop. How, in this time, could one jam a TV signal and replace the audio and video with that of their own? I don’t know the answer to the question, or whether or not it is possible and/or how difficult it would have been in that time. I can’t find any other instances where this has happened prior to this instance

The message [from the broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhNriwaMTQE&fbclid=IwAR2E2j_NVN2lRA5flajLxaXVwvj-_hPmcZSOK6_i2c1twg8rrvfykwoSTG4) reads as follows:

> _This is the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. For many years you have seen us as lights in the skies. We speak to you now in peace and wisdom as we have done to your brothers and sisters all over this, your planet Earth. We come to warn you of the destiny of your race and your world so that you may communicate to your fellow beings the course you must take to avoid the disaster which threatens your world, and the beings on our worlds around you._
> 
> _This is in order that you may share in the great awakening, as the planet passes into the New [Age of Aquarius](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/12/10/the-great-conjunction-on-december-21st-2020-people-are-saying-theres-going-to-be-an-event/). The New Age can be a time of great peace and evolution for your race, but only if your rulers are made aware of the evil forces that can overshadow their judgments._

> _Be still now and listen, for your chance may not come again. All your weapons of evil must be removed. The time for conflict is now past and the race of which you are a part may proceed to the higher stages of its evolution if you show yourselves worthy to do this. You have but a short time to learn to live together in peace and goodwill. Small groups all over the planet are learning this, and exist to pass on the light of the dawning New Age to you all._
> 
> _You are free to accept or reject their teachings, but only those who learn to live in peace will pass to the higher realms of spiritual evolution. Hear now the voice of Vrillon, a representative of the Ashtar Galactic Command, speaking to you. Be aware also that there are many false prophets and guides operating in your world. They will suck your energy from you – the energy you call money and will put it to evil ends and give you worthless dross in return._

> _Your inner divine self will protect you from this. You must learn to be sensitive to the voice within that can tell you what is truth, and what is confusion, chaos and untruth. Learn to listen to the voice of truth which is within you and you will lead yourselves onto the path of evolution. This is our message to our dear friends. We have watched you growing for many years as you too have watched our lights in your skies._
> 
> _You know now that we are here, and that there are more beings on and around your Earth than your scientists admit. We are deeply concerned about you and your path towards the light and will do all we can to help you. Have no fear, seek only to know yourselves, and live in harmony with the ways of your planet Earth._

TV engineers tried to get to the bottom of the interruption and stop it but were unsuccessful. Nobody has ever claimed responsibility for the event and the news episode of that day remains a curious unsolved mystery that will never be explained.

An investigation into this was launched by the Independent Broadcasting Authority, but it’s difficult to find the results. The IBA was replaced in 1991 by the Independent Television Commission, which itself ceased to exist in 2003 when it and other bodies were folded into the new broadcast regulator Ofcom.

David Barnett, a journalist from the Independent [states](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/vrillon-hacking-alien-voice-seventies-extra-terrestrial-hoax-unexplained-mysteries-a8069926.html):

> I asked Ofcom, but of course they don’t keep records from other bodies going back so far. They did point out that deliberately interfering with the UK’s TV and radio infrastructure is against the law, and can affect others who need to use vital airwaves – such as the emergency services.

**Does A “Galactic Federation” really exist?** 

The idea that there is some sort of “galactic federation” of races that represent a benevolent force in our galaxy or universe is not a new idea. Channelers, those who claim to be in telepathic communication with different groups of extraterrestrials, have relayed this idea to the human race for many decades. This idea was recently sparked again when Haim Eshed, former head of Israel’s Defense Ministry’s space directorate, former General and respected professor claimed that the U.S. & Israel have been in contact with intelligent extraterrestrials for quite a long time.  He specifically referenced the “Galactic Federation” emphasizing how they are waiting for humanity to evolve, and that we are not quite ready for contact. This sentiment echoes the message from the broadcast above. You can read more about that story [here](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/12/08/ex-head-of-israeli-space-program-blows-the-whistle-on-extraterrestrial-contact/).

The story was picked up by multiple mainstream media outlets, most of them covered the story with ridicule with some of them hinting to the idea that Eshed has lost his marbles. I find this interesting given the fact that [mainstream media has recently published](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/10/01/and-just-like-that-ufo-crash-retrievals-are-now-mainstream/) various articles in multiple outlets taking the issue of UFOs and the possibility of extraterrestrial intelligence quite seriously, [including CNN](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/08/10/ex-defense-official-appears-on-cnn-stating-ufos-are-clearly-under-intelligent-control/). It’s interesting to note how a story comes out about supposed extraterrestrials urging us to get our shi\*t together is completely ridiculed, yet other incidents with a bit of a [threat](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/10/30/a-question-about-extraterrestrials-on-everybodys-mind-are-they-a-threat/) narrative bias is taken completely seriously.

According to Colonel Ross Dedrickson, who was responsible for maintaining the inventory of the nuclear weapons stockpile for the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the U.S. tried to detonate a nuclear weapon on the Moon for scientific purposes and measurements. He claimed that extraterrestrials “destroyed the weapon” before it got to the Moon, and that the detonation of any nuclear weapon in space by any Earth government was “not acceptable to the extraterrestrials, and that has been demonstrated time and time again.” You can learn more from him in one of his only interviews before he passed, conducted by Dr. Steven Greer, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEYBC8wU9lM&feature=youtu.be).

Former Canadian Defense Minister Paul Hellyer [once stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8il3eedPAA) that “decades ago, visitors from other planets warned us about the direction we were headed and offered to help.”

There are statements from ‘credible’ people with very interesting backgrounds that again, date back decades. Above are a few of multiple examples. Furthermore, video,pictures, radar tracking data and testimony from military agencies regarding the existence of UFOs is, again, quite mainstream at this point in time.

The discussion about extraterrestrials and whether or not they are benevolent or malevolent is a huge discussion, one I’d rather not go into with this article given the fact that I just wanted to relay the story of the supposed broadcast interrupting message, and I’ve discussed it in [many of my other articles](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/10/30/a-question-about-extraterrestrials-on-everybodys-mind-are-they-a-threat/)[, like this one](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2020/10/30/a-question-about-extraterrestrials-on-everybodys-mind-are-they-a-threat/).  Having been a researcher into this topic for more than 15 years I can tell you there is an enormous amount of info to sift through, from documented UFO cases to supposed close encounters and experiences that hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people have had with beings from other planets.

If you’re interested in learning more about the phenomenon you can sift through the [disclosure section](https://www.collective-evolution.com/category/alternative-news/exopolitics/) of our website. We’ve been writing about the topic for more than a decade now.

**The Takeaway**

It’s easy to brush off a possibility or a hypothesis simply because it contradicts what we believe. Humanity has been doing this for quite some time. For example, [a paper](https://www.tsijournals.com/articles/image-analysis-of-unusual-structures-on-the-far-side-of-the-moon-in-the-crater-paracelsus-c.html) published in the Journal of Space Exploration regarding features on the far side of the Moon that may be artificial states the following:

> A decidedly conservative mainstream scientific establishment often rejects anomalies based on the subject matter alone, i.e., there cannot be alien artifacts on the moon because there are no alien artifacts on the moon (or other planets). Such a view is an example of circular reasoning, based on the belief that extraterrestrials do not exist, or if they do exist that they could not have traveled to our solar system.

How much do our beliefs and perceptions about our world limit and hinder our ability to discover and acknowledge ideas and results that may not “fit the frame”? How much do we limit our consciousness and perceptions about our world, who we truly are and what we are capable of as a result of our beliefs, and our determination to say “this is the way things are”?

Sure, there may not be clear evidence of a “galactic federation,” but there is “abundant evidence that…civilizations have been visiting us for a very long time”(Ex NASA Astronaut & Princeton Physics Professor [Brian O’leary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO0T05kQkbs&feature=youtu.be)). There is good evidence for the UFO phenomenon and the extraterrestrial hypothesis behind it, and many people every single day are waking up to this realization.

This topic has huge implications and it leaves no aspect of humanity untouched. It forces us to open up to a broader view of reality and abandon belief systems we’ve held onto for a long time. It raises questions about us, why we live the way we live, the cosmos and the nature of reality. It touches upon history, science, metaphysics economics, education and all systems on our planet. Most importantly, it expands human consciousness to a level we have yet to experience, which in itself will manifest a new human experience as we move into the ‘final frontier.’

As far as the message goes, whether or not you believe it was from an extraterrestrial or a representative of some sort of galactic federation, I am sure you would agree that humanity does indeed need to get its sh\*t together. To bring peace into the world, we must be that peace. We must stop putting our power into the hands of those who do not have humanity’s best interests at hand, and we must ‘wake up’ and see how our world truly operates and why it doesn’t have to be this way. The issue is not finding solutions, because they exist, so ask yourself, what is preventing humanity from implementing these solutions? Why do we operate from a place that desires power, control and profit? Why not from a place of love, understanding, and the desire to do what’s best for humanity. Is our political system really a place to turn to in order to bring about any meaningful change? Why are we always fighting with each other and separated in our beliefs about what’s happening on our planet?  Why are controversial topics and concerns raised by many always ridiculed and deemed a conspiracy theory? Why do we have so much trouble communicating and understanding each other? We need a shift in human consciousness.
