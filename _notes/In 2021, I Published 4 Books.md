## Highlights
- In 2021, I published 4 books.
  In 2022, I plan on publishing 8.
  Here's the 5-step framework I use to write 60,000+ words in 30 hours or less (2,000 words per hour) ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120718873341961))
- Step 1: Atomize
  If you think of a book as a huge wall of text, writing feels heavy.
  But if you think of a book as lots of small sections stacked on top of each other (like LEGOs), writing feels easy.
  12 chapter / 60k words = 5k words per chapter.
  That's a long-form blog post. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120719825485826))
- Step 2: Organize
  Within each of these 12 chapters, make a list of all the Main Points you want to make.
  Chapter = Topic
  Chapter Outline = Everything you want to say about that topic
  Don't bother w/ sentences yet.
  Just list out ideas/opinions/points. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120720651722757))
- Step 3: Synthesize
  After you've listed Main Points in each of the 12 chapters, go back through and look for:
  â€¢ Repeating points (don't inflate word count saying the same thing twice)
  â€¢ Conflicting points ("You said X here, but Y there?")
  â€¢ Disorganized points (wrong chapter) ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120721402548226))
- Step 4: Jazzercise
  Now that you have all your Main Points in the right chapters, start free flowing.
  If you did it right, writing should feel like you're coloring inside the lines (section by section) opposed to painting on a blank canvas.

- Step 5: Crystallize
  You should only get "in the weeds" and start line-editing once you've:
  â€¢ Organized big ideas into 12 chapters
  â€¢ Listed Main Points inside each chapter
  â€¢ Free-flowed inside each Main Point inside each chapter
  Final editing should be quick and easy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120722916651015))
- The mistake writers make is they set out to write a book starting at Page 1.
  This is how I wrote my first book, and it took 4 years.
  Whereas my book, The Art & Business of Online Writing, took 4 months. 
  Writing linearly is SLOW.

  1. Atomize
  2. Organize
  3. Synthesize
  4. Jazzercise
  5. Crystallize ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120724606984193))
