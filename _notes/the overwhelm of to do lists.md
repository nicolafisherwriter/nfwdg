I love productivity apps. I’ve tried them all at some point. 

Lately I’ve been feverishly searching for the perfect app again. I’ve tried several in rapid succession. 

But all I end up with is overwhelm and a long list of things to do. 

I love recurring tasks. They remind me of forthcoming birthdays. When the car insurance is due. 

I’ve realised this past week that my daily recurring tasks are simply a sign of me trying to do too much. It’s overwhelming. 

Every now and again I clear the decks. I pare back, I declutter. This past year has felt like a cycle of decluttering and letting go, acquiring and cluttering, rinse and repeat. 

I try to do too many things at the same time and then end up feeling dissatisfied at how little I achieve.
