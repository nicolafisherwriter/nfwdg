## Highlights
Besides, autumn is a magic trick. Science will scoff at such a notion and confront you with the vocabulary of photosynthesis (the synthesis of organic chemical compounds from carbon dioxide using radiant energy, especially light; specifically the formation of carbohydrates in the chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to light – or, at least, so says my Penguin English Dictionary), which will include super-efficient evaporation, carotenoids, anthocyanins, decomposition of carbohydrates, oxidised tannins, soluble sugars, starches, cellulose, lignum and a complex exchange of gases. But science doesn’t know what I know, and what I know is that autumn is a magic trick we call “leaf”. — location: [154](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B01MFCWG76&location=154) ^ref-44626
