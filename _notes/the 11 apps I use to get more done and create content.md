title: the 11 apps I use to get more done and create content
tags: writing

I'm a bit of a magpie with new and shiny things! I love new tech. These days I try to be practical too.

This is my current setup

## 1. Content Creation

Yes, I totally love **Obsidian**. It changed so much for me, introduced me to the idea of PKM, writing with abundance, and creating a workflow for my content creation. If it's possible for an app to fill me with joy when I use it, Obsidian does!

I use it to manage incoming notes, to write notes and store notes. Obsidian Publish enables me to share my writing in public.

## 2. Project Managing

A late arrival at the party, I dabbled with **Notion** before I settled on Obsidian. I thought they were similar but they're different. Notion is where I project manage and get things done. I thought it had to be either/or when it came to Notion/Obsidian but it turns out, it can be both!

Notion for doing, Obsidian for thinking.

## 3. Reading and Writing

**Medium** is great for new ideas and finding inspiration. All my atomic essays are posted there too.

Favourite articles are saved to **Matter**, and useful tweet threads and Kindle highlights to **Readwise**.

I follow the trail of my thoughts in **Napkin**.

## 4. Voice and Audio

A top recommendation is **Otter** for recording voice notes and transcription. Like all my content, this filters into Obsidian.

**Voxer** is my favourite messaging app.

And **Racket** is perfect for micro podcasting.

## 5. Honourable Mentions

I'm using **Twitter** again! The Obsidian community drew me back in, and the Ship 30 for 30 community kept me there.

**Dynalist** logs my recurring to dos.
