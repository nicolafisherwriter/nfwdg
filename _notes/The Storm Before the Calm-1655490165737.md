## Highlights
Life will never make sense to the mind. It will only make sense; and can only produce long-term, sustained happiness, peace, and joy when embraced from the perspective of the soul. The trick then, if we are not happy in life, is not to leave the body, but to join the soul. This can be done while one is with the body. Yet most people are not bringing the soul into their daily experience. â€” location: [176](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B005GM2R1C&location=176) ^ref-45209
