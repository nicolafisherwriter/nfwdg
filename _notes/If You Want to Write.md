  - > Everybody is original, if he tells the truth, if he speaks from himself. But it must be from his true self and not from the self he thinks he should be. (location: 49)


  - > you are talented, and you are original. (location: 53)


  - > because the most modest and sensitive people are the most talented, having the most imagination and sympathy, these are the very first ones to get killed off. (location: 95)


  - > Imagination Is the Divine Body in Every Man —William Blake (location: 108)


  - > But the moment I read van Gogh’s letter I knew what art was, and the creative impulse. It is a feeling of love1 and enthusiasm for something, and in a direct, simple, passionate and true way, you try to show this beauty in things to others, by drawing it. (location: 204)


  - > I will tell you what I have learned myself. For me, a long five- or six-mile walk helps. And one must go alone and every day. I have done this for many years. It is at these times I seem to get re-charged. If I do not walk one day, I seem to have on the next what van Gogh calls “the meagerness.”“The meagerness,” he said, “or what is called depression.” After a day or two of not walking, when I try to write I feel a little dull and irresolute. (location: 455)


  - > We are always doing something—talking, reading, listening to the radio, planning what next. The mind is kept naggingly busy on some easy, unimportant, external thing all day. (location: 468)


  - > I learned from them that inspiration does not come like a bolt, nor is it kinetic, energetic striving, but it comes into us slowly and quietly and all the time, though we must regularly and every day give it a little chance to start flowing, prime it with a little solitude and idleness. (location: 556)


  - > the deep religious, blissful silence, absorption, and contemplation (location: 573)


  - > I have noticed that two or three very rare, extraordinary, creative people I know, when they are truly magnetic, fascinating, oracular, seem to be living in the present. Francesca is one of them; a little Swedish mystic who sees visions as Blake did is another; and Carl Sandburg, the poet, is the third. (location: 586)


  - > Saint-Beuve said: “There exists in most men a poet who died young, whom the man survived.” And de Musset said: “Know that there is often hidden in us a dormant poet, always young and alive.” (location: 606)


  - > But do not forget to keep re-charging yourself as children do, with new thinking called “Inspiration.” (location: 614)


  - > There is more contemplation there: that is to say, they take time to love beauty. (location: 620)


  - > Only when you are playing in a thing do people listen and hear you and are moved. It is because you are moved, because a queer and wonderful experience has taken place and the music—Mozart or Bach or whatever it is—suddenly is yourself, your voice and your eloquence. (location: 627)


  - > Look at those people who have a genius for being funny. When they are mimicking someone you can see that they are really in a kind of trance. (location: 631)


  - > “In our best and most effective moments, when we really enter into’ our work, we leave it behind... .This is the experience of Pure Spirit when it is turned toward the One. (location: 641)


  - > In other words, it is when you are really living in the present—working, thinking, lost, absorbed in something you care about very much, that you are living spiritually. (location: 644)
