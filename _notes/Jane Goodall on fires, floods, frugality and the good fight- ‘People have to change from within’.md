## Highlights
* I think people have to change from within, not be told: ‘You’ve got to change.’”
  * **Note**: It’s about a shift in mindset. This is fundamental. No amount of legal intervention, investment or politics will have the desired effect without a change in mindset. People have to have a reason to make real change.
