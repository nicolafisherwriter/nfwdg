This week I shared the stages of the Essence Map. Can you look back and see your own experience of the Essence Map? What did it feel like? What did you learn? Where are you on the map timeline now?

Some questions to journal on

-   What are your deepest wishes/most closely guarded secret hopes and dreams?
    
-   What do you yearn for?
    
-   What have you always wanted to do?
    
-   What stops you?
    
-   What would it feel like to get to the end of your life and not fulfilled your dreams?
    
-   When do you feel most like you?
