The path I’ve taken through life has always been circuitous. I’ve headed in one direction and then found I’ve taken detours or gone off track altogether. 

I spent much of my life not knowing what I wanted to be when I grew up.

I certainly didn’t want to be a doctor, the career my Mum wanted me to pursue. Specifically Gynaecology and Obstetrics. It wasn’t for me.

Although I did a teaching module with my degree, it was a fallback in case I ever wanted to teach. I found I didn’t.

I’ve felt like a lost soul or flaky. When others pursued the same career path throughout their working lives, I dodged about here and there. Business Analyst, Consultant, Project Manager, Product Manager, People Manager, Business Advisor. Job interviews became tricky because it just looked like I was flaky. 

It may just be the way I’m made. 

I was convinced that living at a gentler pace was my thing. Then, a series of conversations made me realise that I wasn’t living a gentle life. I was attacking each day at breakneck speed and I didn’t know what to do about it.

A six week programme with Julia Davies called Magic Mondays showed me that neither my Mondays nor my weeks were magical. 

I hate living a lie. Living my truth is massively important to me. But, sometimes life takes over without you realising. It’s only when you stop and pause, take a step back that you can see what’s been going on.
