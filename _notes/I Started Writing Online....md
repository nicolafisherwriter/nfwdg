## Highlights
- I started writing online when I was 17 years old.
  Since then, I've...
  • Written 3,000+ articles online
  • Ghostwritten 1,500+ articles online
  • Published 5 books & 30 "mini-books"
  • Built two 7-figure writing businesses
  If I had to start from $0 again, here's what I'd do: ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539988350644232))
- Step 1: Pick a social platform
  I pick Twitter.
  Say I want to be a freelance content writer. I search "marketing" on Twitter and look for high-performing content.
  I start curating high-performing content, building out my profile.
  Showing off my skills. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539989428547593))
- Step 2: Offer my skills for free
  After curating some world-class work, I introduce myself to top creators.
  Tag them or DM.
  Anyone who responds, I offer my services for free.
  "Let me prove what I can do."
  Someone will say yes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539990212829185))
- Step 3: Prove I'm a good writer, then charge $$$
  The first project is a test.
  • Test for me, to see if I can achieve the goal
  • Test for them, to see if they're someone worth working with/for
  If I'm successful, they'll want more ($).
  If I'm not, no harm no foul. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539991106301961))
- Step 4: Keep curating, keep writing
  As I'm getting my feet wet working for free, I keep writing...
  I keep curating...
  I keep building in public, showing the people in my category on Twitter I am actively participating.
  I'm playing the game. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539992070901760))
- Step 5: Leverage 1st client to a 2nd client
  When the first free project is a success, client will want more.
  Now, I charge (a modest amount).
  But I also ask for an introduction:
  "I'm passionate about writing. Anyone else you know who might need a content writer?" ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539992964292609))
- Step 6: Scale, scale, scale
  My Twitter is growing...
  My 1 client is making an intro to a 2nd client...
  My curating other people's content is leading to more outreach...
  Now, I have 3 different streams bringing me opportunities.
  Each new client I take on, I raise my prices. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539993887121409))
- Step 7: Trim the client roster and increase profitability
  Once I reach my ceiling in terms of hours I can work, I look to replace my lower-paying clients.
  I tell them, next month, I'll need to up the cost.
  The right ones will stay. The wrong ones will leave. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539994780512258))
- Step 8: Reinvest $$$ into productizing myself
  Once my client roster is full and 80%+ are paying full rate, and I've raised my prices as high as they can go, the only way to scale beyond is through products.
  I start turning my knowledge into:
  • Books
  • Courses
  • Software ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539995699064842))
- Step 9: As product revenue increases, I shed clients
  I look at the revenue of each client, and when a product starts making me the equivalent ($$), I let the client go.
  Time invested in client work scales linearly.
  Time invested in products scales exponentially. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539996642693125))
- Step 10: The goal is to flip client revenue with product revenue
  Eventually, I get to a point where what I'm earning from products has 90% replaced what I'm earning from clients.
  Now, I can be even pickier.
  Client work becomes "gravy on top." ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539997674487816))
- This Twitter thread is exactly what I would do to rebuild myself as a writer.
  It's the fastest path to profitability.
  Fastest path to becoming known for a niche I own.
  And it's also the biggest hedge against risk.
  Every step builds on the previous one. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539998622453769))
- Anyone can do this.
  And anyone can execute all 10 steps in less than a few months.
  Maybe even less than 30 days.
  Anyone who follows this Thread and levels-up as a result, DM me.
  Because I want to invest in you. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1458539999578705921))
