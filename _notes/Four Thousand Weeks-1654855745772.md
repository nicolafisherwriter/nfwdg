## Highlights
It’s the very last thing, isn’t it, we feel grateful for: having happened. You know, you needn’t have happened. You needn’t have happened. But you did happen. – DOUGLAS HARDING — location: [217](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=217) ^ref-23198

The average human lifespan is absurdly, terrifyingly, insultingly short. Here’s one way of putting things in perspective: the first modern humans appeared on the plains of Africa at least 200,000 years ago, and scientists estimate that life, in some form, will persist for another 1.5 billion years or more, until the intensifying heat of the sun condemns the last organism to death. But you? Assuming you live to be eighty, you’ll have had about four thousand weeks. — location: [222](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=222) ^ref-29560

‘This space that has been granted to us rushes by so speedily and so swiftly that all save a very few find life at an end just when they are getting ready to live,’ lamented Seneca, the Roman philosopher, in a letter known today under the title On the Shortness of Life.3 — location: [234](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=234) ^ref-54896

It follows from this that time management, broadly defined, should be everyone’s chief concern. Arguably, time management is all life is. — location: [242](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=242) ^ref-2279

Not only do we need to manage time but we need to prioritise our time. Really focus on those things that add to the sum of our happiness. Not waste time going down rabbit holes that don’t excite us, inspire us, make us happy or are someone’s else’s rabbit holes.

The world is bursting with wonder, and yet it’s the rare productivity guru who seems to have considered the possibility that the ultimate point of all our frenetic doing might be to experience more of that wonder. — location: [246](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=246) ^ref-55523

This is living at a gentler pace. Time management the AGP way.

The world also seems to be heading to hell in a handcart – our civic life has gone insane, a pandemic has paralysed society, and the planet is getting hotter and hotter – but good luck finding a time management system that makes any room for engaging productively with your fellow citizens, with current events, or with the fate of the environment. — location: [247](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=247) ^ref-15539

The world around us is going to hell in a handcart. But that doesn’t mean we have to. It means we have to:

• live our lives
• be in the moment
• pursue our joys

The only time we have is now and this is where we create the world we want to live in.

We’re obsessed with our overfilled inboxes and lengthening to-do lists, haunted by the guilty feeling that we ought to be getting more done, or different things done, or both. — location: [255](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=255) ^ref-8199

Take the daily battle against online distraction, and the alarming sense that our attention spans have shrivelled to such a degree that even those of us who were bookworms as children now struggle to make it through a paragraph without experiencing the urge to reach for our phones. What makes this so troubling, in the end, is that it represents a failure to make the best use of a small supply of time. — location: [265](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=265) ^ref-50272

So much to do, so little time. When do we get to the point of appreciating that time is finite? When will we be here now? Do we only get the urge to live when we know we will die?

But we all know we will die. Are we just afraid to live?

The pandemic has led many to fear living. Their lives have shrunk and they have shrunk. We visited a normally upbeat and vibrant woodturning club recently. It was like visiting a different club altogether. The members were quiet, subdued and, in many ways, less than who they used to be. 

The pandemic had reduced their lives. They were afraid to live. 

How can we still embrace our lives even in the midst of a pandemic?

Viktor Frankl quotes?

Or perhaps your problem isn’t being too busy but insufficiently busy, languishing in a dull job, or not employed at all. — location: [268](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=268) ^ref-3568

Been there, done that!

In 1930, in a speech titled ‘Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren’, the economist John Maynard Keynes made a famous prediction: within a century, thanks to the growth of wealth and the advance of technology, no one would have to work more than about fifteen hours a week. The challenge would be how to fill all our new-found leisure time without going crazy. ‘For the first time since his creation,’ Keynes told his audience, ‘man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares.’13 — location: [322](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=322) ^ref-29495

The environmentalist and spiritual writer Charles Eisenstein recalls first sensing this basic ‘wrongness’ in our use of time as a child, growing up amid material comfort in 1970s America: Life, I knew, was supposed to be more joyful than this, more real, more meaningful, and the world was supposed to be more beautiful.14 We were not supposed to hate Mondays and live for the weekends and holidays. We were not supposed to have to raise our hands to be allowed to pee. We were not supposed to be kept indoors on a beautiful day, day after day. — location: [340](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B07X3DH41F&location=340) ^ref-43183
