# how a new beginning completely changed my life

The new beginning most often comes when you least expect it.

After my Mum died, my Dad and I bought a property together. I was happily single with no thought of a relationship. I busied myself at work, and looked after my Dad. I was sure my future was mapped out.

Then fate put a blind man on my path.

## When you've done the work, the door opens

This was May 11th, 2015. Chris had lost his sight in 2008. After four traumatic years of coming to terms with being blind, he had carved out a new path for himself.

18 months after my Mum's death, I had done the same.

We were happy in our skins and with our lives. We had each found our centre. It was from this state of balance that we connected.

## When you know who you are, others see the real you

We found ourselves sitting at the same lunch table. I did my version of the Spanish Inquisition, asking Chris questions about his life as a blind man. He observed me and got me in a way no sighted person ever had. The second time we met he recognised my voice and greeted me with such joy, it blew me away. I will always remember that moment!

We became the greatest of friends. I still thought my life was on a different track.

## Life has other plans for you

Fast forward six years. Including a fairy tale wedding. A dream life in the country with a man who makes me laugh every day and who still sees me better than anyone.
