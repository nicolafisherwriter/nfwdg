# how to live a gentle life when you want to do it all

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is it possible to do it all and still embrace life at a gentler pace? Perhaps we have to compromise somewhere along the way.

Iâ€™ve been seeking out a gentler pace since May 2019 when I first declared this intention on my blog. Some time later, my venture of the same name was born.

But I've learned that living life gently isn't so easy.

Since 2019 we've moved house, travelled the country fulfilling a season of woodturning demos, completed filming projects and commissions. At the same time I was growing my client work and my own projects.

In August we were both overwhelmed with all the plate spinning and booked three days away. Just 25 minutes down the road, we slept a lot. 

The remainder of this year is fully booked.

Hmmm. Not so gentle. 

I've always been a plate spinner. I'm one of those multipassionate people. Going down rabbit holes is my thing. 

Right now I want to do so much. To develop my writing. To create a book. To work with more clients. To read, to explore new tech, to dig deeper into PKM. 

And spend more time outside. To walk with my camera. To spend time with cows. 

To truly live a gentle life.

I believe that embracing a gentler pace is good for us and also the world around us. In fact, I think it's the key to transformation. I just haven't worked out how to make it a reality.

This may be what I explore during Ship 30 for 30. How can you live a gentle life and still do it all. Or can you?
