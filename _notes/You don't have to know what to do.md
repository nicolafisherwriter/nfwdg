### “I didn’t know what I was doing, which was a good thing because if you don’t know what you’re doing, you don’t know what the rules are, and you find yourself at a door marked ‘no exit’, and discover that you can walk through it and nothing is going to stop you. It’s just that no one has walked through that door before....I can point to the first eight episodes of Sandman and say they were me writing as someone else. ...I was finding out who I was. Somewhere in there I thought "Oh, I think this is what I sound like." I think it was Chuck Jones who did the Bugs Bunny and Road Runner drawings who said “You have a million terrible drawings inside your pencil and you need to get them out so the good ones can come out”, and I feel that way about everything I wrote before that story. Actually there are some good things but anything good I wrote before then is me sounding like someone else.”
