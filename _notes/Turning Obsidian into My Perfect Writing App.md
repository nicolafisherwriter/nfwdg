## Highlights
* The defaults are actually pretty good, but here’s the key settings you want if you’re going to use Obsidian for writing: * Make sure that Auto pair Markdown syntax is toggled ON. This creates both symbol and places the cursor in the middle, making it easier to create italicized or emphasized text. * Make sure Smart indent lists is toggled ON. This makes it easier to create bulleted and numbered lists quickly, automatically adding the next bullet when you hit the Return key. * Make sure that Fold heading and Fold indent are toggled ON. This creates carats for Markdown headers as well as indented text, adding some cool outliner-inspired features that make it easy to fold up text in large files and focus on the text you want.
