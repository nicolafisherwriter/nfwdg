Hello! And thank you for dropping by.

I’m Nicola Fisher and I’m with Bamber, my [husband](https://bit.ly/tbwfilm)’s Guide Dog, in the photo above. On one of our local walks down the lane. As soon as I put on my pink boots, Bamber’s ready to go. He always wants to come along with me.

We relocated from Lancashire to Derbyshire in October 2020. I love our life here — it was the fulfilment of a long held dream, for me, to move to the Peak District.

I describe myself as a Writer, Photographer, Podcaster and Geek. That’s the quick version. My corporate career included consultancy, project management, people management, business advising and mentoring.

#### writer

Writing was, for a long time, something other people did, not me. It was a pie in the sky ambition. That’s changed in the past year — mostly thanks to [Obsidian, PKM and Second Brain](https://medium.com/talkingtech/obsidian-is-a-game-changer-if-you-want-to-write-a-book-50f91f782584). Together they sent me down a whole new rabbit hole where I discovered digital writing and content creation. Learning from established online writers shifted my mindset, and introduced me to a style and format that I’ve embraced. While I often hesitate to call myself a Writer, writing now occupies much of my time, and is my big focus.

#### photographer

My first camera was a tiny 35mm baby. Then only 9, I loved the anticipation of the postman arriving with my developed prints. A later purchase, a Fuji 1.1 Megapixel digital camera created a similar rush as I dashed home to download my photos on to my blueberry iBook. Although I love my DSLRs, I most often use my iPhone 11. I’m a huge fan of street art and grunge photography.

#### podcaster

Audio is the perfect outlet for me. An introvert, I much prefer asynchronous conversations. You’ll find me mostly on Voxer. While I’m not a great chatterbox, I enjoy 1:1 conversations with podcast guests, or just thinking out loud on my solo podcasts.

#### geek

My love of tech goes back a long way. I’ve always been an early adopter. Logging on to the internet at some point during the early 1990s was my own version of Alice in Wonderland — straight down the rabbit hole. Back then I started building HTML websites and writing my first blog. Sadly, lost in the mists of time.

I write about a range of topics but my most popular content has been [tech and tool](https://medium.com/talkingtech) related. I share my favourite apps in a way that makes it easy for anyone to get started, not just the tech savvy.

[My husband is completely blind](https://nicolafisherwriter.medium.com/i-met-a-blind-man-and-reader-i-married-him-f6abaa505bad) and a Woodturner. We travel around the UK giving woodturning demonstrations and sharing Chris’ story. We’ve had the BBC here a few times and a 12 man crew from Google.

When I’m not online you can find me out walking, taking photographs or typing on my Erika Robotron 155 typewriter. I’m a fan of stationery and have a large collection of fountain pens, several made for me by Chris.
