Rest is not idleness,  
And to lie sometimes on the grass under trees on a summer's day,  
Listening to the murmur of the water,  
Or watching the clouds float across the sky,  
Is by no means a waste of time ~ [John Lubbock](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=60086307ee&e=bc5cbc9b90)
