To be human is to become visible  
while carrying what is hidden as a gift to others.  
To remember the other world in this world  
is to live in your true inheritance.  
You are not a troubled guest on this earth,  
you are not an accident amidst other accidents  
you were invited from another and greater night  
than the one from which you have just emerged.  
Now, looking through the slanting light of the morning window  
toward the mountain presence of everything that can be  
what urgency calls you to your one love?  
What shape waits in the seed of you  
to grow and spread its branches  
against a future sky?  
Is it waiting in the fertile sea?  
In the trees beyond the house?  
In the life you can imagine for yourself?  
In the open and lovely white page on the writing desk? ~ David Whyte, [What to Remember When Waking: The Disciplines of an Everyday Life](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=601e4fc9f4&e=eb9759f735)
