When you’re a kid the first thing you want martial arts to help with is breaking shit. You want to set up planks and bricks and bust them in two with karate chops. So I was heartened when in the first lessons the master said there was a simple technique behind the breaking of objects. Don’t aim for the target. Aim beyond it. Because the master said if you aim for the surface, your fist will stop there. If you aim behind, it will keep travelling through. And it’s true.

When I started taking my book seriously, I had to find a way to think of the job...The aiming point had to be beyond the target, so its pressure load spread over a wider area. I had to not only commit to finishing a full length novel. Better still I had to think of a novel as a beginning. it would be a trilogy of novels. It made the first effort an opening gambit.

It no longer mattered if the work was going to be an immovable object. I was punching through it or breaking myself in the attempt. As for whether to conceive of the job as hard or easy, it meant I did neither. I didn’t need that. It just needed doing ~ [D.B.C.
