Perfectionism is just, it’s a serial killer that just goes around killing joy, spontaneity, wonder, grace, humility, it just kills them all. Perfectionism, I think, is a particularly dangerous kind of fear. I always call perfectionism, “fear in high-heeled shoes,” because it’s fancy, it’s like a really fancy haute couture version of fear because perfectionism can advertise itself as a virtue, and it can trick you into letting it think that it makes you special.
