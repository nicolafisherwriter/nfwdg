  - > My goal for this book is to illustrate the potential you’ve got inside you, right now, to do something unique and innovative. I know this because I have that same potential, and I struggle to let it out sometimes. You won’t know how far your potential reaches until you start experimenting with it and pushing its boundaries.

  - > I choose my own path. I stay true to myself and to my values. I experiment with choices. I might be afraid, but I don’t let fear stop me from trying new things. I can only live a meaningful life if I keep making choices and moving forward, pushing past my fears and testing my limits. (location: 165)
