### Highlights & Notes

- On Glasp, go to “My Highlights” select ONE highlighted page that you like and click the “Share Your Highlights” button.  Download the file as an “MD file” (Markdown file) type, and from then save the file on the folder or vault you created on Obsidian.
  - Notes: Genius! I wasn't using Glasp a lot although I liked the idea of it. Now I can export to Obsidian, it becomes a perfect tool.
