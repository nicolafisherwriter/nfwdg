## My notes

My original note about thinking of Obsidian in terms of a house was intended to help new users, who often talked of feeling overwhelmed by Obsidian, to simplify the process.

The analogy works but the practice can differ. Do you plan first or let things evolve organically?

Do you build the house, and then add the foundations?

Both are possibilities. Plus, you may knock down the house altogether and rebuild at a later date. But the furniture will still remain. The structure will change.
