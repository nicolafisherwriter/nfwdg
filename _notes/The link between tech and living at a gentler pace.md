I'm trying to understand the link between tech and living at a gentler pace. I know there is a logical connection there but I've yet to clarify that. 

There is a triangle of content that I want to create. The three points are:

- writing
- tech
- a gentler pace (shortened to *essence* - maybe, but no-one understands that. I also like *go gently*. The *gentle* bit is hard to articulate. *Gentle* on its own makes no sense. Neither does *gentler*. I don't want *slow living* because it's not appropriate here. There's also *genius*, *self*, *daemon*. But then we're really going off at tangents. *Source* but what does that meant to most people? *Creative* and *creativity*. *Oneness*. This is the one I like the best. You've got *reconnect*, *reboot*, *realign*).
