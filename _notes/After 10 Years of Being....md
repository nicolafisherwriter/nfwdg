## Highlights
- After 10 years of being a wannabe creator I've 200x'd my creative output in 6 months with one simple hack 👇
  I hit publish 200 times 😬
  Here's 10 of my best anti-hacks for showing up daily as a creator👇🧵 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097011262603264))
- Focus On Today 📆
  Don't worry about tomorrow, next week or 30 days from now. Focus on hitting publish today, then do the same tomorrow and the day after that. 
  All that matters today is that you hit publish. The numbers will take care of themself. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097012223156227))
- Trust The Process 🧐
  Your day 1 is probably going to suck. You're probably going to be disappointed with how many people engage. You're probably going to think there is something wrong.
  There's nothing wrong. You're just early in the process. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097013015875592))
- Obsess About What Matters 🙋🏼
  Should you write threads? Should you write essays? Should you do it this way or make it that colour? All of that is peripheral to what matters... good writing.
  Good writing will transcend any format or medium or platform. So focus on writing. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097013745635331))
- Don't Box Yourself In 📦
  Content buckets are good for generating early ideas. But don't be afraid to explore your interests. You'll never know if it hits with your audience until you ship it.
  Be curious, experiment and dance with ideas. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097014584492035))
- Show Up. Especially On The Hard Days 😵
  Prolific writers aren't blessed with sunshine and rainbows everyday. The only difference is they have discovered how to show up on the hard days as well as the easy ones
  The only way to not quit...is to not quit ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097015469584384))
- Embrace the Chaos 🤯
  Maybe you didn't finish onboarding, or your system isn't perfect, or you missed your sacred time. Or you don't have all your ideas in order.
  Ship anyway. Life isn't perfect. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097016308355072))
- Give Up Overthinking 🤔
  Will anyone really notice if I don't publish?
  Am I good enough?
  No one is going to be interested in this
  Who am I thinking I could be some kind of writer?
  Overthinking will make you crazy. Hitting publish is the cure. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097017289912320))
- Listen For Signal 🩺
  Critical writing feedback is good, but don't miss the real feedback. Every like and every comment and every DM (or lack of)... IS THE FEEDBACK. 
  It's all a signal for what resonates with your audience. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097018028077056))
- For goodness sake... Have some fun 🥳
  One time I compared shipping to a big old ugly container ship. But writing in community is more like a fun cruise ship.
  Write, publish, make friends, form friendships. Join the party up on deck! ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097018984370177))
- Pat Yourself On The Back 😄
  Because for everyday that you hit publish there are hundreds of others who wanted to but didn't.
  You've already won, my friend. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1447097019785437197))
