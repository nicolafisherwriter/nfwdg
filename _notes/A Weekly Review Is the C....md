- 💬 What is a weekly review?
  Productivity expert and author, David Allen, describes the weekly review as a time to:
  • Gather and process all your stuff.
  • Review your system.
  • Update your lists.
  • Get clean, clear, current and complete. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1432357115167903747))
- 💬 How do I carry out a weekly review? 
  I start with a short journal entry in @obsdmd 👇

- 📝 First, I look at the previous week’s review, then I reflect on the progress I made against my annual goals. After that, I do some 'Plus, Minus, Next' journalling (thank you @ness_labs for a great reflective framework). ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1432357158960648198))
- ✅ Once my journal entry is complete, I check off a few actions in my task manager, @TickTickTeam.

- 💬 Why is a weekly review so important?
  The review helps me transition from consumer to creator and supports my love of lifelong learning by triggering my personal knowledge management workflow.

- 😰 Without a weekly review, I would be more anxious. Two of my biggest stress triggers are emails and 'fear of The Unknown'. Getting to Inbox Zero every week and knowing what's coming up (as much as I can) reduces my anxiety levels considerably. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1432357180376760325))
- 🎯 Finally, my weekly review keeps my annual goals front and centre. If I did not see them every week, I'd forget about them.
  My weekly review helps me be productive, prioritise my wellbeing, and achieve my goals. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1432357182436167683))
- 🗓 One of the biggest challenges of completing a weekly review is doing it consistently. I recommend adding ‘weekly review’ to your calendar, as well as ensuring it is on your to-do list or task manager. Set a reminder. 
  Pretty soon, your weekly review will become a habit. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1432357184164220930))
- @NotionHQ and @obsdmd users can get my free weekly review templates below. There's an annual review template available, too, which I highly recommend.
