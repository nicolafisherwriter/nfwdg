I worked with just over a hundred clients in my role as a Business Advisor in Manchester. They were SMEs, ranging from one man bands with no staff to businesses turning over millions and with up to 250 staff. Inevitably, some were more successful than others but they all wanted the same thing - to grow, to make money and build a reputation.

A pattern soon emerged. It didn't matter how much they turned over or the size of their business, I had pretty much the same conversation with them all. Their challenges were most often similar. One theme that constantly amazed me was around self-confidence. It impacted sole traders, CEOs of businesses turning over millions, and business owners who were well known. The common denominator was their humanity - human beings doing their best on whatever scale they operated.

I developed a process that I used time and again with my clients. I'm going to share this below and use [Chris](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk), and the development of the Blind Woodturner, as the example.

As I write this in 2021, we’ve had an amazing few months. Chris has been filmed by a production company for a BBC documentary, Blind Ambition, which went live in August. A huge project, that has been almost three years in the making, was finally filmed at the end of July, and we're now recording another BBC project, Money for Nothing. Chris was also interviewed for the August issue of Derbyshire Life magazine.

Since April, Chris’ work has been displayed and sold in a gallery in Ashbourne, which had been one of the goals in our plan for quite a while.

It’s easy to look from the outside in, as we all do, and think that these opportunities have come about by chance. That Chris has suddenly been plucked from obscurity. But they are the result of six years of planning, dreaming and believing, often working for nothing or next to nothing.

While the end goal was always to spread the message that, whatever life throws at you, you can rebuild; to inspire and motivate people, and to share Chris' story of hope, we had a strategy behind the scenes to help us achieve that.

This is how we did it.

### put your head above the parapet

When we first met in 2015, Chris had his own YouTube channel and was regularly recording and uploading videos. He was building a following and starting to become known in the maker community. We added Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to the mix, built a website, and started a mailing list.

I became Chris' personal business advisor and he will tell you the phrase that he heard most from me was, _you have to put your head above the parapet_.

If you want your work to be seen, you have to be visible. You have to be willing to show up. And, yes, believe me, I know how much of a challenge this can be! However, Chris is brilliant at it. Once I'd shared the concept of putting your head above the parapet, he embraced it wholeheartedly.

Chris has now mastered Instagram and TikTok, and posts regularly on those. He shares his process, behind the scenes, bits from our life, plus what he's been turning. We document his journey, his projects, and what he's working on right now.

Doing this has been instrumental in both sharing Chris' story with his followers but also demonstrating his credibility for other opportunities that may arise.

### start small

We have been thrilled by and grateful for every opportunity that has come our way. Each one has been another piece of a bigger jigsaw. They helped us establish our media page, be found on Google, and share the back story about Chris and his work.

We saw each new opportunity as another rung on the ladder, often with one opportunity leading naturally to the next one.

The trick was starting small and using each interview, article, film as a stepping stone to the next thing.

### network

Networking was my bread and butter when I worked in Manchester. I met many hundreds of people and, at some point in our conversations, and when a natural opportunity arose, I would tell them about Chris. I shared his story. Often that would be the end of it but it was another person who knew of Chris, and someone who might pass that on.

On several occasions a brief conversation led to something more.

One of my clients, who we also commissioned to create the Blind Woodturner brand and logo, mentioned Chris to a contact at the BBC, which led to radio and television appearances, and put Chris on the BBC's radar.

On the strength of the initial BBC coverage, further content was published in outlets around the world. It was also the catalyst for other requests to film Chris.

It's very easy with networking to think that your efforts have no impact. But that's not true. I remember speaking to someone once at a networking event. Eighteen months later they got in touch to commission some work. You really never know. Always keep an open mind.

### if you don't ask, you don't get

I'm a bit brash about going after what I want. Over the years these have mostly been experiences. I learned early on that if you don't ask for what you want, you're never going to get it. And, the worst that someone can say to you is no!

I was lucky to be part of a business community in Manchester where I met and worked with many different people, which opened up many magical doors.

And once I got an idea in my head, I had to follow through.

I’d come across an amazing guy called Chris Maguire who hosted many of the business events I attended. He could elevate even the most tedious topic with his wit and humour. He was also active on Twitter and, once, I was included in the thank yous at the end of an event even though I had just been in the audience! I'd tweeted how much I loved events hosted by Chris Maguire.

Yes, I meant every word but it was also my way of putting my head above the parapet.

Come the day when I managed to speak to Chris and pitch him about the Blind Woodturner, I wasn’t a completely unknown. I also stood out because I had white hair and often wore a bright pink jacket. (Make yourself memorable - in a good way, of course!).

From that conversation would come a podcast, a magazine interview and a short video.

And the start of the Blind Woodturner's public speaking career!

### grab opportunities

I’d spotted an event hosted by Chris Maguire about how to public speak and guessed, from previous experience of similar events, that there would be a chance for people in the audience to speak on stage.

Chris and I attended. It was a great event. And then the moment came. I grabbed Chris’ arm and raised it even before he did. Chris Maguire had already been primed, and when he spotted Chris' arm in the air, he chose him as one of the speakers.

### dream big

When I get this right, amazing things happen. Mostly, with everything we have achieved for Chris, the stars have aligned and opportunities have come together with relative ease.

I've always done this thing throughout my life, especially with something I'm very passionate about - I've spent a long time daydreaming about the outcome I wanted. During my thirties, I compiled a little book. The idea came to me on a drive home from work. Within 10 minutes the whole concept was clear. I just had to implement it. Fast forward a few months and the book was self-published, stocked in the (then) Virgin Megastores, launched at the Groucho Club with a number of celebrity guests, plus lots of press coverage.

There's a lot of science out there about manifesting and making things happen. The way it's worked for me, it seems, is in creating an emotional connection to an idea or project. (This isn't something I've consciously done). I know, with my little book, that having the whole picture in my head, from start to finish, made a huge difference. I'd dreamed it all up before I even started.

We've done the same for Chris. We started with a dream and a plan and then worked our way through it. We're still doing that now.

### start from scratch

PR was never really one of my skills. I made it up as I went along. But I did research how to write a good press release and attended a workshop that still reminds me now to make it easy for the journalist.

I've had good success with my attempts at PR. Having good examples on our media page has definitely helped and I've shared these to create a back story for the journalist who reads my email.

Start where you are. Build as you go but have a plan of where you're heading.

### be organised

When you're starting out is the best time to collate and build your story. Document everything. Take photographs. Keep notes. Initially it might seem as though they're drops in the ocean but, gradually, they will create your back story.

Start a media page on your website. Even if there are only a couple of entries, it will grow.

Always have examples of your work to hand, short videos, or social media posts that you can share. Chris is really good at this. Recently we stayed at our favourite place, Biggin Hall Hotel. As you do, we got talking with a number of people and Chris showed them videos of his work. One couple visited Ashbourne, spotted one of the pieces, that Chris had shown them, in the gallery, and went in and bought some of Chris' work.

### say yes to everything

In the early days, we said yes to every request. Chris featured in local press, appeared on local radio stations, spoke at small gatherings. We did a lot of charity events where Chris shared his story. One thing often led to another.

It all helped and we are still amazed when we meet someone and they say they heard Chris speak at one of these tiny events.

As time goes on, you have to prioritise. But, at the beginning, use every possible opportunity that comes your way, however insignificant it may appear.

### give it away

In the first few years of growing Chris' brand and sharing his story, most of what we did was unpaid. And, just in case you're wondering, appearances on the BBC don't pay at all! But there was a payback. Chris' audience increased as a result of television and more people became aware of him.

We gave away a lot of Chris' work too for charity auctions and raffles, for good causes and as thank yous.

You can't do it for ever, especially if you want to grow a viable business, but much of what we did in the early days was an investment and has paid off in some way or other.

2021 is the first year that Chris has been paid for media appearances. Still not all (BBC!), and we're being more strategic now and not saying yes to everything.

### have a good story

Chris' story is unusual. He tells it well too. But the greatest asset to his storytelling is his lived experience. As a blind man, scripts are of no value to Chris. He simply stands up and talks. He'll tweak his story depending on his audience but essentially he speaks from the heart.

Because of my love for the Hero's Journey, I spotted the same themes running through Chris' life. I shared Joseph Campbell's concept with Chris and he will often use that as [the mechanism for sharing his story](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/change/). You can do this for your own story too.

Never doubt that you have a good story to tell. You just need to excavate it. A great way to do this is to ask others how they see you. It often surprises me!

### do your own thing

We had no road map when we set out. We had absolutely no idea how things might evolve. And we had no aspirations for TV documentaries. We just hoped that more people, especially outside the woodturning community, would hear Chris' story.

We did make it up as we went along. I was constantly looking for new opportunities but not only looking, also pursuing them.

Make a bold plan and start working your way through it. You will be amazed at what unfolds!

### there is no overnight success

Of course, there is no overnight success. But there is chance, synchronicity and luck. To harness all of these you have to put in the work first. To create the conditions for what you want to transpire.

> Follow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you, and the life you ought to be living is the one you are living. When you can see that, you begin to meet people who are in the field of your bliss, and they open the doors to you. I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid, and doors will open where you didn't know they were going to be. If you follow your bliss,doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else ~ Joseph Campbell
