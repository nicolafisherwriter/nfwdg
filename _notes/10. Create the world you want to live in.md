> Never forget that you are one of a kind. Never forget that if there weren’t any need for you in all your uniqueness to be on this earth, you wouldn’t be here in the first place. And never forget, no matter how overwhelming life’s challenges and problems seem to be, that one person can make a difference in the world. In fact, it is always because of one person that all the changes that matter in the world come about. So be that one person.

### We are a network of light

I imagine essence as a tiny inner light. It glows brighter the more we embrace who we truly are, when we peel back the layers, and as we follow our bliss. Our essence illuminates when we are at our most connected and aligned.

To save the world, we start by saving ourselves. The Essence Map takes us along a route where we will experience many losses, sometimes it will feel as if we have lost sight of our self.

> And Merlin call’d it ‘The Siege perilous,’  
> Perilous for good and ill; ‘for there,’ he said,       No man could sit but he should lose himself:’  
> And once by misadvertence Merlin sat  
> In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,  
> Galahad, when he heard of Merlin’s doom,  
> Cried, _‘If I lose myself, I save myself!’_
> 
> 96. From ‘The Holy Grail’, Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892)

We are all journeying back to our source, our essence. This is a path we travel alone. It is through our losses or endings that we find ourselves, and are saved. We discover our flow and what gives us fulfilment. We tap into our wyrd, our unique soul signature.

_I envision a world where each of us lives in alignment with our truth._ When we find the light within, we are lit up. Others, seeing our light, seek their own. We each light the touch paper for another. Like a ripple effect, we change our immediate world and the world around us.

As more people connect to their essence we build a network of light that spans the globe.

What if, in saving ourselves, we save each other?

Can it be that simple? I think so.

When we pare back the non essentials, we are left with only the essential.

### The power of the collective

Until we, as individuals truly recognise our connection to each other, I wonder whether we can ever bring about change. What if, by understanding how we are all connected, we could gain the impetus needed to nurture our environment and planet? What if we understood that nature is an extension of ourselves?

> We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.
> 
> #####   
> Albert Einstein

We may need to live and work, and collaborate in new ways. The whole landscape of our existence is there to be revolutionised. That may appear incomprehensible if we simply think in terms of how we live and work now, but makes sense if we adopt a different mindset.

### Unconventional thinking

I’m not a conventional thinker and perhaps my view of the world is naive but I have a theory that the real solution to the challenges we face collectively lies deep in the heart of each one of us.

External shifts can only happen when we change the way we think about our self, treat our selves, nurture our selves. Because, if we don’t care about our self, how can we truly care about others and the planet?

> _We do not need magic to transform our world. We carry all of the power we need inside ourselves already_.
> 
> J K Rowling

The world has been commoditised. I don’t think that was how it was meant to be. We work to live, literally. To earn sufficient money to pay for our natural resources. I think we’ve dug ourselves into a great big hole and now we’re not sure how to climb out of it.

Technology seems to connect us and it is a fantastic tool. As a geek, I love my tech, but the connection it gives us is one dimensional.

While we are connected more than ever by our technology, we are isolated like never before.

We are members of the same community, connected by virtue of our humanity.

Our world is designed to keep us apart, to create competition, one upmanship. It’s not designed to bring us together, to share resources, or to help one another, but I do believe that if we adopt new ways of living, we can create a different world.

### What actually matters?

There is so much in the world that doesn't truly matter. On our death bed are we going to regret that wildly expensive gizmo/handbag/car that we didn't buy, or that we didn't spent more time doing what sets us alight?

> The industrial system we all live in is outcome-based. It’s about guaranteed productivity in exchange for soul-numbing, predirected labor. But if we choose to look for it, there’s a different journey available to us. This is the path followed by those who seek change, who want to make things better. It’s a path defined by resilience and generosity. It’s outward focused, but not dependent on reassurance or applause.
> 
> Godin, Seth. The Practice (p. 7). Penguin Books Ltd. Kindle Edition. 

This other path requires us to step far out of our comfort zone. To extricate ourselves from this industrial system and forge our own path takes immense courage, a willingness to fail, a deep desire to follow our heart. 

It means listening to that relentless inner voice that whispers to us: you’re wasting your life, you can be so much more than this, you have so much to offer, you’re here for a different purpose, when will you do something that fulfils you and brings you joy?

We’re living at a time when massive shifts are taking place in the physical and spiritual worlds. I ask myself every day, what sort of world do you want to live in? I know I have to create that world for myself. And that’s what I do.

### Map of Consciounsess

Taking place in our world right now is a pivotal moment for all of humanity. I talk about these moments a lot in the Essence Map, usually in relation to our personal lives. But the same process is playing out on a global scale. It's the conjunction of different cycles, some coming to an end and others starting. New beginnings emerge from chaos and that is what is unfolding.

The world we inhabit can be either a benign or hostile environment depending on our outlook on life. Which means we can each create our own world. Simply by changing our thoughts.

The status quo is being challenged. Change is on the cards.

Vibration and frequency reflect how you feel. Dr David Hawkins devised [the Map of Consciousness](https://mlzqmxtcq2io.i.optimole.com/ovdMa9U.AmHq~57cdb/w:auto/h:auto/q:auto/https://maestralaynah.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/levels-of-consciousness.001.jpeg), a scale of emotions which starts at the bottom with fear, grief, anxiety and moves up towards joy, peace and love. The premise behind the map is that everything we do has an impact, and creates a ripple effect. Our emotions are contagious. So we have the power to impact all of humanity just in the way we think and feel.

Negative emotions make us feel downcast rather than upbeat, and often reactive, unlike joy, love and peace. We are then proactive and in flow. The more we can be in a state of joy or following our bliss, increasingly great opportunities come our way and magic tends to happen.

> I have a vision of a world where we naturally connect to our essence, and where we each play a part in transforming our lives on this planet.

What sort of world do you dream of? What life do you really want for yourself? If you can think it, you can create it.

It starts with each of us.

### What makes you come alive?

The Essence Map has always been about the journey back to our selves, a reconnection to our essence, our truth, our uniqueness. But it is also, ultimately, the route back to Source, the divine, our roots or whatever that might be for you. I've always believed this, but downplayed it for fear of sounding too woo woo (but, actually, I am very woo woo!).

The Essence Map plots the route we take to become enlightened beings. It also maps what is happening in the world as our planet moves to a higher level of consciousness, as is the cyclical and natural order of things.

> Don’t ask yourself what the world needs; ask yourself what makes you come alive, and then go do that. Because what the world needs are people who are alive.

### Your vision, your world

I dream of a world where we live at a slower pace, find time to smell the roses and the coffee. Where people connect with who they really are and, in doing so, have the potential to create a better world. To be in a world where people live in alignment with their true essence, understand their connection to the planet, and value and nurture the natural world around them.

It might seem pie in the sky but this is what vision is all about. 

My vision links back to wanting to make a difference, freedom and balance, as well as what I list on my website: living unconventionally, creatively and seasonally.

_What is the secret dream that drives you?_

Part of the purpose of the Essence Map is to lead us to a deeper connection with ourselves. Once we have begun this journey it naturally takes us down new paths and to a greater appreciation of our connection with each other.

As with personal change, what is happening around the world represents a rite of passage for the whole of humanity. It may not be easy. But it is an opportunity to embrace new ways of living, to be reconnected with nature as our ancestors were, to live in harmony with the seasons and cycles. We are returning to our own essence and that of our planet.

I don't do politics and have no idea of the difference between left and right or who is left or right. So, this is not about socialism or communism or any other ism. My vision is of a world where everyone's needs are met. Where resources are shared between all.

My view may appear simplistic. I believe we would all benefit from going back to basics. Our planet is designed to provide us with the resources we need to survive and thrive. Not through us plundering those resources but by taking what we need, safeguarding for the future, cultivating and regenerating.

What if the concept of money was taken out of the equation? Or, at the very least, we return to an exchange of energy or goods, not this constant quest for more and more profit to make the minority rich.

It may take some time for a vision like this to be achieved and it may not be the direction in which we ultimately head. But, hopefully, something similar.

The past year or so has demonstrated that it's entirely possible to get the global collective on board with an idea. So, changing our mindset in other ways is equally viable.

We need to see ourselves as part of the natural world, not apart from it. We have become increasingly separated from nature by industry and commerce. But it's by spending time in nature that our desire to be reconnected arises. It is in nature that we begin to realign with our essence.

We are at the foot of the mountain where immense change is before us, a challenge, and an unknown future. We must be ready and willing to adapt, to be prepared to go with the flow, to release and let go of our expectations of life as we know it and have the courage to cross a new threshold in order to birth a new world.

Whatever that might look like, we need to be willing to create systems to support all individuals equally, to provide opportunities for all to live in peace and harmony with each other and the natural world.

It's about creating a world that truly works for everyone, not just a few.
