I had to surrender to my own mediocrity. I’m going to write as well as I can. The measuring stick is not, ‘Do other people love it? Did it win the National Book Award?’ But rather, ‘Did I do the work?’ and, ‘Did I do it as well as I could?’ Answering yes to those two things is my guiding light. That’s what I go back to all the time. We are in charge of the work we do and whether or not we give it our all ~ Cheryl Strayed
