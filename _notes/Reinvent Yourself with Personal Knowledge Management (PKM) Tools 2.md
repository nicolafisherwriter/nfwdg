The history of personal knowledge management (PKM) is a history of curiosity. For thousands of years, people have accumulated knowledge in a desperate attempt to find no-nonsense answers to nagging questions.

-   “What is the universe made of?”
-   “What makes us human?”
-   “What is the meaning of life?”
-   “Isn’t he a little short for a stormtrooper?”

PKM is a revolution. It's a renaissance. It's the missing link between us and all the information we want to consume, process and create. 

It gives us the ability to make something of the information we gather.
