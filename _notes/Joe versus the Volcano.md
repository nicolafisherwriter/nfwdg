[Joe versus the Volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Versus_the_Volcano) is the story of Joe, a hypochondriac living a half life, working a dead end job. Diagnosed with a terminal condition, his doctor urges him to go and live his life, while he can. 

Joe quits his job and, the next day, meets a business man intent on mining a rare element from an island. Standing in his way is a tribe who will only allow access if someone is provided as a sacrifice to the fire god. They must jump into the volcano.

With nothing to lose Joe agrees.
