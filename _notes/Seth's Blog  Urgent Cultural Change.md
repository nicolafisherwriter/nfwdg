- Category: #articles

## Highlights
- In the last ten years, the culture has changed dramatically. We’re buffeted by shifts that are faster and more widespread than anyone can recall.
    - Note: The rate of change has increased dramatically. The world around us has shifted more in the last century relatively speaking than at any other time. And that rate of change increases. Is this a good thing? I’m not sure. Probably not. We weren’t meant to live at a rate of knots.
- Our response to change is often all we have control over. And the way we respond is how we create the next cycle of culture and possibility.
