## Highlights
- Our brains aren’t designed to work intensely for eight hours straight. We get tired, burn out and productivity goes out the window.
- Are these the right accolades and projects I should be doing? How do these things add value? Does being involved with them keep me 100 percent engaged? Do they consume me while I’m doing them or does a part of me die inside when I see it in on the list?
    - Note: That’s the crux of the matter: ‘does a part of me die inside?’. So many times I’ve done jobs that have made me feel dead inside. A great barometer of whether you’re living ‘on purpose’.
