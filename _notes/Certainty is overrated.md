### “Certainty is overrated. Being uncertain is fine. Don't worry if your thoughts feel vague, if you don't have enough 'material'. Once you start putting pen to paper, or tapping the keyboard, you'll see that details come.  
At first, like an ant.  
Just the one.  
Then, another ant.  
Two tiny details that bring life to your spacious abstractions.  
\-- Is that a third ant?  
Keep writing. Or do something else altogether, but notice that more ants appear, drawn into the void by those first pioneers. Before you know it, your writing is a busy little world of ant-trails and cargo systems and nest-building and connections.”
