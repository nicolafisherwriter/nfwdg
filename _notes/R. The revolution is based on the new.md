The revolution has to be based on _new_ terms and _new_ solutions.   The planetary alignments of last year were signifying a breakdown in what is traditional, and that these traditional ways were decaying and crumbling through greed and the desire for power.   It is what does _not_ conform to the old that will bring the ‘breakthrough’ moment.  So fear not if you are branded a conspiracy theorist just because you question and you think differently - that means you are here to try and bring about change, which hopefully can save humanity.  You are a vital part of the planetary dance.  Whilst there may be no going back to the old way of life we had, we _can_ strive to find clues as to how we can live our best life for the future.  Passivity is the enemy – it’s not an option to do nothing.
