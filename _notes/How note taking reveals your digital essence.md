To mention _note_ and _life changing_ in the same sentence seems improbable. It is true that note taking has transformed my work and life. I’ve come across others saying the same.

I was 57 when I came across note taking in its current form. I’d been a life long note taker. But these were random, disconnected notes. Often written in notebooks and forgotten. The new notes are different.

They work for you. They join up with other notes. They link in linear and more circular ways.

All thanks to note taking apps like Roam Research, Loqseq, Notion, Zettlr, and my favourite, Obsidian.

Imagine a bucket. Add notes, web clippings, files, quotes, references. Before they go into the bucket, hashtag them. Mix it all together.

Then, magically, all these disparate notes form links to one another. It’s no longer a bucket but a rabbit hole.

Graphs and search are the tools that map your dive into Wonderland.

#### Choosing your notes

> You don’t get to pick your family, but you can pick your teachers and you can pick your friends and you can pick the music you listen to and you can pick the books you read and you can pick the movies you see. You are, in fact, a mashup of what you choose to let into your life. You are the sum of your influences. The German writer Goethe said, “We are shaped and fashioned by what we love.*”

Note taking is about collecting ideas, references and resources that mean something to you. They resonate or inform. They inspire or edify. Each collection of notes is unique to its creator. Over time, this Second Brain represents that person. It is, in some ways, reflective of the creator’s _essence_.

By looking in someone’s Vault, we can immediately see their interests, passions and, sometimes, career trajectory. We could probably describe them fairly well based solely on what’s in their vault.

You can draw your own conclusions from these digital garden examples.

#### A creative process

My Obsidian vault has evolved to become a key element of my creative process. Over 12 months my notes have evolved, multiplied and grown. As I’ve found my note taking and writing voice, I’ve shared more of myself in my published digital garden.

#### A Second Brain allows your First Brain to think

> Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them ~ [David Allen](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)

By creating a repository of meaningful content, I no longer have to remember which book talked about topic X or which quote referenced theme Y. Tags, search and links resurface this detail for me. Thus freeing up my thinking brain.

#### Obsidian has upped my creativity

I’ve become a more prolific writer by using Obsidian. Not just because it provides me with a space to write articles, but it facilitates creativity in other ways.

Obsidian is part of my workflow. Content flows in and out. Workspaces outline my next tasks and my content calendar. Notes are not just text but data that can be analysed.

> The artist is a collector. Not a hoarder, mind you, there’s a difference: Hoarders collect indiscriminately, artists collect selectively. They only collect things that they really love*.

Artists are collectors.  
Note takers are collectors.  
Therefore, all note takers are artists.

Maybe.

Our creativity comes into play when we gather and write notes. They become a _mashup_ of us, who we are.

#### Embracing a gentler pace

Aligning with our creative selves happens when we’re in flow. It requires paring back, slowing down and reconnection.

It’s in our flow that we find that zero point where we come face to face with our essence.

These repositories of notes that many of us are building evolve slowly, with time. They are a representation of us, our passions, our loves. Perhaps a Second Brain is our _digital_ essence.
