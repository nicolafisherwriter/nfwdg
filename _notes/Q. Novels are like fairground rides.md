Writing fiction is not "self-expression" or "therapy". Novels are for readers, and writing them means the crafty, patient, selfless construction of effects. I think of my novels as being something like fairground rides: my job is to strap the reader into their car at the start of chapter one, then trundle and whizz them through scenes and surprises, on a carefully planned route, and at a finely engineered pace ~ Sarah Waters, [Rules for Writers](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3D1664e186e0%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C47937246e2fb456488b708d9500d6669%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637628840753545119%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=SPJJWhPDdJIfxiBbt7qU7n75WTZAouXxKPGYiUAEFGo%3D&reserved=0)
