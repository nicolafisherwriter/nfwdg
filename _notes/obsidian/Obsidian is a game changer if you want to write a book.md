**This is the process I’m using to write my book.**

My big focus for 2022 is on publishing a book. It’s a goal that’s been on my list for eons. (_Write it down, make it happen_, and eventually it does!).

Although I’ve dabbled with writing over the years — journaling, fountain pens, blogging, eBooks — I’ve never taken it seriously enough to believe that I could write a book.

In April 2021, I first came across [[Obsidian]]. It lit a fire beneath me. In some way it tapped into my psyche, matched my thought process and, for the first time ever, made writing a real possibility.

I can only say all this in hindsight. Now, nine months later, I have the beginnings of a second brain, replete with everything I’ve created. eCourses, newsletters, blogs, notes, references, quotes, as well as several attempts early on to outline a book.

#### how Obsidian made a real difference

Think of Obsidian like a bucket. Pour everything into it. Your ideas, your thoughts, other people’s ideas, references that resonate.

Create a workflow using tools like Matter, Readwise, Pocket, Kindle (and many others) to filter all this content you’re reading into your Obsidian vault.

I’ve saved anything that has appealed to me, spoken to me, or been relevant to the topics I explore.

Now, they sit there, searchable, tagged, some in folders, ready.

#### ship 30 for 30 played a part

My Twitter renaissance introduced me to Ship 30 for 30. Atomic Essays popped up in my timeline. 250 words or thereabouts. How doable was that! In October and November, I spent 30 days writing 30 essays.

Some of my essays were well received. It spurred me on.

I came across others who inspired me with their writing. And Dickie and Cole, the hosts of Ship 30 for 30, taught me so much.

Most recently, Cole [posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/status/1478120718873341961?s=20). He shared his process for writing 4 books a year (last year). He plans to write 8 books this year.

Cole’s model fitted perfectly with my thinking, and added another layer that improved the viability.

#### one book split five ways

My plan — write one book in five sections. Each section is standalone. But will, at the end of the year, form a complete book which I aim to self-publish.

Obsidian lends itself to this process.

#### start with the outline

I created a single page table of contents. Broken down into the five sections, each with its own outline.

Using already created content, I mapped relevant notes to a section by adding a backlink. Systematically, I went through my entire vault to build the outline.

I incorporated Cole’s suggestion of writing 12 chapters per book into my outline, and did more note mapping.

#### make it easy for the beta readers

As I can publish my writing using Obsidian Publish, I plan to share my pre-published books with beta readers.

I extracted the content for each book into separate folders to make a clearer delineation. It makes writing easier for me, too.

I prefixed each note with a number to clearly link it to book 1 or book 2 etc. Then I dragged and dropped all the files into the appropriate folder using the Finder window on my Mac. Another benefit of Obsidian — local files.

My Obsidian vault rearranged itself automatically. I republished everything.

#### reusing notes

For any sections that will need to appear in all books, such as the copyright notice, resources, bibliography etc, I created separate notes and backlinked them where required.

Any changes I make throughout the year to these sections will be reflected in each place.

#### putting it all together

I’m using a plugin called Longform to compile my books and I envisage this will come into its own when each book is ready to be released.

#### a work in progress

Even though I’ll be publishing a new book once a quarter, using Obsidian will allow me to make changes right up until the end of the year. I suspect there may be instances when I will move content to another section, where it makes more sense, later on.

I’ve written eBooks in the past. I’ve used Word, Google Docs, Scrivener but none of them have made it as easy as Obsidian. Being able to work with small blocks of content is less overwhelming. Like doing a jigsaw, you know that, once you have all the pieces, you can put it all together.
