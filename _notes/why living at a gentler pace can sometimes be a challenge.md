# why living at a gentler pace can sometimes be a challenge

I spent much of my formal working life hustling and crushing it. Always driven, I was a perfectionist and an over achiever. If targets were set, I would aim to exceed them.

After I left my day job in April 2019, it would take more than two years before I began to relinquish that work mentality.

The idea of pursuing life at a gentler pace first began nudging me when I was in my thirties. It was twenty years later when I finally answered the call. When I did, I learned that the transition from crushing it to a gentle life isn't an easy one.

## 1. The dream versus reality.

In my day job I dreamed daily of a life spent walking country lanes, communing with cows and forging my own path. Yet, when I finally achieved that dream, I defaulted to my day job routine.

I had to gradually chip away at my old habits, create new ones, and make it a daily discipline to follow my bliss.

## 2. Make a list and consult it.

My journals are littered with passages describing how I craved daylight on those dark Winter days when I was cooped up in an office. I made lists of all the things I would do ... one day.

When the day finally comes, read your lists and plan how you will make them a reality.

## 3. Give yourself permission.

It's easy to be swayed by responsibilities and other demands. Every day we have to give ourselves permission to carve out time to live our gentle life.

We are programmed for busy-ness. We need to re-programme ourselves for a gentle life.
