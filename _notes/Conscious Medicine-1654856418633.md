## Highlights
‘Is this a friendly universe?’ Einstein suggested that this is the most important question we can ask ourselves. It is central to being in the wave response. In the wave response, you are connected with your higher self, your expanded consciousness, the self that is inseparable from the universe. You connect to the flow of Source energy, and move into a state of heart coherence. — location: [2091](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004CVKQAM&location=2091) ^ref-34743

If you decide that you are unworthy of love at the age of five, it can affect your relationships for decades to come. You are likely to choose partners, bosses and even friends who mirror back your ‘unworthiness’, and deepen your insecurity. Our beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies. Likewise if you decide that it is your fault if a parent is distressed or angry, and that you are not being good enough, you will be easily controlled by guilt in later life – and might find it hard to love and nurture yourself. This can be reflected in eating a poor diet, not taking exercise, not getting enough sleep, working too hard (in order to ‘feel good’) or simply not having much fun. — location: [2844](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B004CVKQAM&location=2844) ^ref-27852
