I am possibly evangelical now about Obsidian but, with good reason. Using it has revolutionised my work, writing and how I organise my life.

One of the issues I've had in the past is trying to organise my thoughts too early in the process. When I've been working on a project, creating an eBook or an eCourse, I've tried to make it logical when really my brain works better when I can simply download a lot of information, park it and then come back to it.

This is how Obsidian can work for you. I say 'can' because it's so customisable, you can make it exactly your own.

I started by creating a folder in my Walled Garden (my private notes), and then added ideas and possibilities into separate notes. After a while I created an index. And this is where the genius comes in. I outlined the 21 days and pre-created the notes that I wanted. Simply by using the [[square brackets]], I'm telling Obsidian that I want to create that page. All I have to do is click on the link in the preview (as opposed to edit) window and, voila, the page is made.

I had been saving a variety of posts on Instagram that spoke to me and were ideas I wanted to discuss in Boot Club. Each had its own note. The same for quotes that I had found. Book references.

I recorded notes to myself straight into Obsidian and saved the voicenote file into the Boot Club folder.

All the notes were tagged with topics so I could easily search later for specific themes. This would also highlight where I'd been talking about The End in Week 3 when that information was designated for Week 1. I could then simply relocate it.

As well as tagging, there are backlinks. So, where you reference another note, a backlink will be created to make the connection. This is really useful as a mini CRM. 

Because Obsidian is written in .txt notes, I can edit the notes very easily. Although I do have the Obsidian app as a beta tester, you can edit your notes using an app like 1Writer.

The joy for me is that I don't have to get my thoughts completely straight. I can throw everything into the mix and allow it to percolate.
