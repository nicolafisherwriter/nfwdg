title: the solitary endeavour of our lives

Human beings are pre-programmed to be social animals. We are made to connect.

In Wayfinding: The Art and Science of How We Find and Lose Our Way, Michael Bond describes how two tribes:

> … the Kung and the Aché think nothing of walking a few dozen miles to exchange stories and news with another group, though both are outclassed by the Hiwi in Venezuela, who have been known to walk sixty miles through day and night to visit a neighbouring village before walking back again a couple of hours later.

Today we might connect more online than in real life and, even those of us who embrace our deeply introvert tendencies still crave some form of interaction with others. It can give us validation but also show us where we fit in.

Deep down, we all want to belong, and to find our place.

This journey though is, essentially, a solitary endeavour. We may be surrounded by others, but no-one else can navigate our life for us. We each have to scale our own mountain. Who are we when we stand at the bottom of that mountain, unencumbered, gazing up at the peak we hope to reach?

The path that lies ahead of us is our life. It is the road that leads us home to ourselves, to the sheer magnificence and innermost essence of who we are.
