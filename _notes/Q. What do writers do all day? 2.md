So, most days I spend a few hours trying to make something happen in language. I stretch out on the bed, or on the couch, and tap away - dreams, rants, what happened yesterday, whatâ€™s tugging shyly at me or having a tantrum trying to get my attention. I have organised my life around a belief in writing and a need to get it done, to spend long hours gazing up into the night sky of my brain, lit with memories and fugitive thoughts and propositions. Whatever the effects on the larger world, writing is the record of one consciousness trying to make sense of it all, or at least to transcribe some of the mysteries. It comes from showing up to the blank page, the empty file with its blinking cursor, and hoping the Muse will honour her end of the bargain and keep the appointment. What do writers do all day? Eventually we get down to our true work, and keep at it ~ Kim Addonizio, [Bukowski in a Sundress: Confessions from a Writing Life](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=11920a5fa1&e=eb9759f735)
