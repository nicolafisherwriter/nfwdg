## Highlights
- Unless Twitter is your full-time job you don't need to spend hours every week writing tweets to fill up a schedule.
  Here are 10 frameworks I use to write a full week of tweets in less than one hour👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1440785294458974210))
- Always be collecting ideas 🧠
  👉 Start a list in your favourite note tool called Tweet Ideas 
  👉 Throw random ideas in throughout the week
  👉 Batch write your content once a week from that list.
  Now, onto the frameworks 👇 ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1440785296048594951))
- Mine Your Previous Content 💎
  For each essay I write I go back and extract content to use for tweets:
  👉 Quotable Thoughts
  👉 Listicles
  👉 Questions
  This tweet came directly from an essay I wrote

- Use Life Lessons & Observations 🤔
  At the end of each day I ask myself 'What did I learn today?' and jot that down in my tweet ideas list. 
  This one was just an observation about how I learned by pressing buttons

- Showcase What You're Building 🚧
  In @austinkleon's book Show Your Work he suggests sharing small parts of things that you are working on. Screenshots, videos, and photos work well.
  I love to share videos of parts of my products that I'm working on

- Ideas From Notes 📝
  As I'm processing notes and tending to my Zettealksten, I'll craft tweets from what I'm reading or discovering.
  This tweet idea came from a video I was watching

- Conversations As Fuel 💬
  Schedule conversations with other creators. You'll find it a powerhouse of ideas and insights. Then jot down interesting things in your idea list. 
  This one was a result of a conversation with @learningobsessed
  https://t.co/YBcZVOt0gu ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1440785310963564555))
- Show How You Work 👨‍💻
  People love to see behind the scenes of how you work. Whether it's a way you use your tool or wield your craft. Share your workflows to help others.
  Here's one I wrote on how I practice writing better headlines
  https://t.co/tWCwg5asIk ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1440785312955830273))
- Secret Hacks 🤫
  There are probably things you do every day that are obvious to you, but not obvious to someone else. 
  Like this little tip about sorting youtube videos by date uploaded rather than letting the algorithm show you the same old stuff.

  I found a new Twitter app that I was excited about here

  Absolute gold 💎
