- 1 - Make capture effortless. When youâ€™re running on empty, you need a speedy, easy, simple way to get ideas from your head or inbox into your PKM system. Prioritize apps you can use from your phone. Choose ones that let you forward emails. Connect it to your smartwatch. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elizabutlermd/status/1456298881168252936))
- 2 - Keep your organization minimal. If you set up a complex, impeccable folder system that takes hours to maintain every weekâ€” it will fall apart the first time you have even a moderately busy week. Be okay with the 80% solution. Use full text search capabilities liberally. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/elizabutlermd/status/1456298882271354892))
- 3 - Design your PKM system to help your future self. Write down gift ideas months before you need to buy them. Forward those work PDFs to your database and add some tags so you can find them months later. Your system should offload stress for you, both now and later.
