I make sure I never face a blank page. And I actually give that advice to young writers, not to sit down in front of a blank page, and the way I do it is that I go to the page when I already have a thought, a sentence or a note that I want to make. So, it’s very quickly not blank. It could be a line of dialogue or it could be something that I overheard (…) Then I come back to it later, read it over, and I’ll revise it even if I’m not intended to do anything with it. I want it to be as good as it can. Then I’ll see if it has enough substance and interest to grow into something longer ~ [Lydia Davis](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3Dea19176c3e%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7Cda2c5f368488497a390a08d942b195e2%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637614152755491864%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=PHNTGHqcALduxPmdZvXnKnvZ%2BtHeydEwFHvPCL2HBnA%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=ea19176c3e&e=d0baf97615.
