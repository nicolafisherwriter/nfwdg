## Highlights
- Being a creator and having a day job is tough. 
  Your process will never look like a full-time creators
  Deep work? Forget it. Cabin in the woods? Nope.
  If you want to produce you'll need to learn how to create in the chaos of real life. Here's how I do it ðŸ‘‡ðŸ§µ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296743186915330))
- Start to think like a boxer. Boxers stay light on their feet. The lighter on their feet, the stronger the punches. 
  My creator processes are all about light touches, minimal effort and incremental progress. Here's what that looks like ðŸ‘‡ ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296744063504392))
- Brain Dump
  This can happen anywhere, anytime. It's my number one rule of ideas capture. 
  Have an idea? Take a few minutes to write down a few lines, bullet points, a scratching in stone - ANYTHING to get it out of your head. Your future self will thank you for it. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296744957005830))
- Create A Next Up Pile
  Keeping a few things on the go in different stages of development is KEY to the light-touch approach. 
  Do a little writing on one, add an idea to another, work on the headline for something else. Easily switch between each depending on time & energy. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296746060095490))
- Create A Loose Outline
  Once I've got a dump of ideas, I'll start looking for the main ideas, organising & rearranging them into a loose outline. 
  Sometimes I'll even switch to my iPad to map it out and brainstorm each component. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296747041562628))
- Pull In Your Notes
  Before doing any writing I'll search my notes to see if I have any that can be used for this content. My content is richer because I have a library of notes to pull from.
  Using & Re-using notes & ideas will save you loads of time when it comes to writing ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296748148776965))
- Let it simmer - Keep your ideas front and centre
  My Up Next Pile is always pinned to my Roam sidebar. Having it visually there helps to keep it front and centre in my mind.
  And when new ideas come I can just quickly jot down thoughts as I'm going about my day. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296748920582154))
- Keep your ideas front & centre so your brain is constantly focusing on them in a light-touch way. 
  ðŸ‘‰ Pin what you're working on in a notes app
  ðŸ‘‰ Use 3x5 Cards on your desk
  ðŸ‘‰ Keep a Widget on your phone home screen
  As ideas come to you jot them down throughout the day ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296749843255302))
- What I love about the simmer model is that I can pull out my notes anywhere and noodle over them. Sitting on the bus, out on the balcony, down at the beach.
  You don't have to wait for the perfect time. 5 minutes here or there can move you forward in significant ways. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296750875074565))
- Your Ideas Have Space
  Incremental progress means your ideas have space to breathe. They actually become richer over time and you end up with a much better output than if you just sat and wrote for 90 minutes. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296751890182145))
- Pull it together
  By the time I pour a glass of wine at 5pm and start to think about pulling something together to publish, I've pretty much done the heavy lifting.
  All it takes is a couple of final tweaks to hit the publish button. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296752783568899))
- You don't need to quit your day job and become a full-time creator in order to be prolific. You might just need to adjust your process for a lighter touch and rely on the magic of incremental progress. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/evielync/status/1451296753735675906))
