It all started when I saw him with Diane Keaton in Baby Boom. There was a slow burning pursuit and a scene at the bonnet of a car when Diane Keaton flops about like a rag doll, weak at the knees and overcome by Sam Shepard. 

And so was I. 

Sadly I wasn’t intent on writing. Back then it was a distinctly pie in the sky pursuit, and I didn’t join the dots about Sam’s writing. I vaguely knew he was a playwright but not enough to read any of his work. Sam Shepard, the writer, was complaining separate from Sam the heartthrob actor. 

It’s really only been since his death that that the enormity of his writing prowess has hit home.
