## Original Note

## When you look at 2020 and 2021 in a new light a form of magic happens (that you’re about to learn).

A new year is an opportunity to take your regrets and turn them around. When you take action it creates automated motivation. Here are some simple upgrades you can try in 2022.

The last two years have been difficult thanks to coroni-macaroni.

You might be exhausted. You might have F’d up some goals. You might feel lazy. You might be shaming yourself.

Don’t.

If you’re still here and showing up each day after 2020 and 2021, you’re unstoppable. You survived one of the most difficult times in human history, so you’re stronger, not weaker.

Difficult times build mental toughness.

[Books are great](https://medium.com/curious/i-learned-an-entirely-different-way-of-reading-books-that-doubled-the-number-i-read-814b4014da3b). They can teach you a lot.

I recently discovered you can finally export all the highlights you make with a Kindle eReader or the Kindle App. ^b7e46e

In the top right-hand corner of each book is a share button. All you do is tap “share via email” and all your highlights are downloadable.

There’s even a website ([see here](https://read.amazon.com/)) that contains every Kindle highlight you’ve ever made. How does this upgrade your life? Simple.

Become a collector of sentences in 2022. Play with them. Tweet them. Rewrite them. Add your own thoughts to them.

Sentences lead to life-changing ideas.

The life you want comes from a handful of asks.

So you better get good in 2022 at asking. An ask is simply a question. Don’t expect an answer and you won’t find yourself getting pissed off so much.

The key isn’t to ask more. The key is to ask in different ways.

What I do when a major ask gets no reply is to leave a gap of blank space. I will ask the person again in a few months. Recently I asked a famous author a question after trying for the last 5 years.

They finally responded. I found the right balance between their selfish interests and my future vision for online writing.

Most people don’t ask enough times. Make asking a daily habit.

There’s a bunch of internet bros running around. They teach hustle. They call themselves night owls. They believe morning routines are stupid because not everyone is a morning person.

Let me squash their tiny brains into jelly.

John Constas [taught](https://twitter.com/JohnConstas/status/1462923123007889413?s=20) me that all supposed night owls have done is poison themselves with blue light.

When you’re exposed to too much blue light from tablets, computers and phones, your brain can’t work out if it’s nighttime anymore. I use Apple’s nighttime filter once the sun goes down to reduce the effects of blue light.

Relook at your exposure to blue light.

Writer Sean Kernan forced me to [rethink](https://seanjkernan.medium.com/four-things-you-should-stop-staring-at-immediately-296748b6dd82) motivation.

When your body’s dopamine levels are constantly spiked and crashed by your daily habits, it leaves you demotivated. The pool of dopamine your body has access to becomes less.

This causes your baseline levels of motivation to decrease. So it takes more effort to reach the same levels of motivation you had before you started spiking your dopamine levels with a new unconscious habit.

Social media stats are the worst offender. They mess with your internal reward system. You start wanting _more, more, more_ when you let dopamine spikes run your life.

Sean says, “Checking your social media upvotes only causes a dopamine hit and crash, which leaves you less motivated and more addicted to Facebook.”

Do a [dopamine detox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk) to reset your dopamine levels and recalibrate your motivation levels.

Two years of no gym, thanks to the global health crisis, has been tough.

Going back is hard when you’re not used to it. I was born a couch potato so it’s even harder for me. There’s a simple hack. Find an excuse to exercise. I’ve chosen external gym motivation for 2022.

I go to the gym to look good for my wife.

Since my return to the gym I find that some days I don’t want to go. Then I learned an important lesson.

The days you don’t want to workout are the days you must. Off days make the good days better.

The internet has overloaded our brains with too much information.

As a result our memories are struggling to keep up. The answer is a second brain: a note-taking app. If you’re not already, get yourself a powerful notes app and use it. Don’t just write boring to-do lists in 2022.

Write your goals down. Write your vision for your life. Write what you’re grateful for.

The biggest one is this: Start a new note where you record all of your own personal stories. The big events of your life are forgotten if you don’t write them down. Even if you remember some of them the tiny details get lost.

On the day of [my wedding](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/i-got-married-finally-5c4c5658b95b), for example, I wrote down how nervous I was and described the tiny butterflies in my stomach. I want to make sure 2030 Tim doesn’t act like GI Joe when describing the day again.

The best notes app I’ve found is Roam Research. There’s no hierarchy of notes so you don’t need to do any sorting. And for the first time, AI helps to join together unrelated ideas so you can experience idea breeding.

Many goals never happen because we try to do them alone.

For years I wanted to start an online academy. I didn’t have the complete skill stack to make it work. I launched three different times and failed every time. Even with an email list full of tens of thousands of subscribers, I couldn’t make one course sale.

What changes is when you co-build.

Yes, the pie of results you get must be divided up.

But 100% of nothing is nothing.

Collaboration is the key, especially if you want to [make money online](https://medium.com/swlh/making-money-online-is-stupidly-simple-if-you-allow-it-to-be-53ab9b9da4d9). Choose a goal in 2022 and then build it with another person.

> You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take — [Wayne Gretzky](https://www.forbes.com/sites/actiontrumpseverything/2014/01/12/you-miss-100-of-the-shots-you-dont-take-so-start-shooting-at-your-goal/?sh=21beed1e6a40)

If you want more results in 2022 then you must learn to lose more. Take more shots. Perfection teaches you nothing. It holds you back.

The goal in 2022 isn’t to beat your co-workers, neighbors, fellow content creators, or family. Trying to beat people only leads you to become a jealous, envious, competitive little a-hole.

Solution: Beat who you were exactly 12 months ago.

That’s a game you can win. That will make you feel good. That will give you realistic motivation that can change your life.

My biggest lesson of 2021 came from a sudden tragedy. It’s led to a major life upgrade. Here it is.

You can lose it all. So enjoy the process more than the outcome.

## My Note

### Topic/subject I'm writing about: Celebrate, you've achieved more than you think
- interesting hook (draft a few)
- when you look back on the past year, what have you achieved? 
- have you achieved what you set out to do? or something different/even better
- I haven't achieved what I thought I would so I decided it didn't count. But I achieved other things.

### Body of the post
- tactics people can use
- interesting examples
- Let's celebrate

---

The world we live in is a reflection of our perspective and beliefs. Our outlook defines the world around us. We have to work at fashioning that world.

I believe this entirely. It does take some work, however.

Start where you are now, at the tail end of 2021. How has this year been for you? I mean, really been? Not the external but the internal. What has been your focus? How have you spent your days? And what do you now want to change?



1. choose a word of the year

I've been doing this for several years now. I've had joy, powerful, sovereign. My word for 2022 is wyrd! To me, it's a magical word that ties in with essence, it's about becoming, being more aligned with who you are. I'm fascinated by the idea of web of wyrd which has connotations of oneness and connection. I say often that, if we all connected to our essence (our wyrd), we could change the world. 

There are lots of ways to choose your word. I come up with mine by following my intuition. I first came up with sovereign when it popped into my head and I instantly dismissed it. Then it was repeated in countless articles, posts and books that I was reading. 

Usually I know I've got the right word because there's some sort of emotional response. It feels either too big or challenging. Or, as is the case this year, there's some deeper past life type connection.

I like to start choosing my word in December. I jot down contenders. Usually a short list. I don't spend a lot of time on the process. I may park it and let things stew for a few days or so. 

Don't force it. Your word will come to you.

Once I've settled on my word, I order a bracelet with the word in morse code.

2. celebrate your wins

I'm notoriously bad at celebrating. I'm an expert at dismissing what I've achieved. This year I didn't achieve some of the things on my list. I achieved lots of other things but I completely dismissed them because they weren't part of my original plan. When I sat and compiled a list of everything I'd done, it was a pretty decent list.

I spotted a post on Instagram talking about impact. She listed the numbers of people who had attended workshops, done 1:1 work with her. It was a substantial number. A great way to look at the impact you can have and the people whose lives you can touch.

If I add my numbers and include the Blind Woodturner numbers, we've touched around 800,000 people. Again, because Chris is the Blind Woodturner, I've not included all the work we've done this year, or things I've facilitated in my own list. But maybe I should.

Find your numbers. Add in everything, absolutely everything. You might be amazed.

3. plan your year

I love to plan. It gives me a sense of control but it also takes away a lot of the thinking. If I have a plan, I can get up in the morning knowing what I need to do instead of having to work it out every day.

Write down your goals. At one stage, I did this every year. I would write down a list of my goals. I would put that list away and rarely refer to it again until later in the year. Amazingly, the majority of the items would be complete. There's great power in putting out into the universe what you want.

4. how do you want to feel?

5. embrace endings and loss

6. take notes

One of the best and most life changing discoveries of 2021 for me was Obsidian, the concept of a second brain, PKM (personal knowledge management) and how all of that might fit together. It transformed my content creation, helped me build a workflow and taught me that I no longer needed to work from a blank page. For example, the inspiration for this post originated from [here](https://medium.com/mind-cafe/ten-things-to-upgrade-your-life-in-2022-1c08922f75e3). 

Although I didn't keep up with my Daily Notes 100%, being able to look back on things we've done, places we've been, and what I ticked off my list each day gives me a greater sense of achievement, especially at times when I ask myself *what am I doing with my life!*

Since April when I first started using Obsidian, I've built a repository of writing that is now the starting point for 2022 projects. I've saved and collated a ton of references, quotes and information that I can refer to. I could have done more but am happy with what I've pulled together so far. Without Obsidian most of that information would have been lost.

7. save your highlights and favourite ideas

8. goal setting

9. journal every day

Save your memories

10. expect more, risk more



### Call to action
- ask for a comment/reply
- what are you celebrating from the past year?
- what do you regret? how have those things made you who you are now?
