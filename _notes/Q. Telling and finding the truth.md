For the first time in my life, I realized telling the truth was way different from finding the truth, and finding the truth had everything to do with revisiting and rearranging words. Revisiting and rearranging words didn't only require vocabulary; it required will, and maybe courage. Revised word patterns were revised thought patterns. Revised thought patterns shaped memory. I knew, looking at all those words, that memories were there. I just had to rearrange, add, subtract, sit, and sift until I found a way to free the memory. The truth was that practicing writing meant practicing sitting down, sitting still, and my body did not ever want to be still. When it had to be still, all it wanted to do was imagine dunking with two hands or kissing a girl who loved me. Sitting still, just as much as any other part of writing, took practice. Most days, my body did not want to practice, but I convinced it that sitting still and writing were a path to memory ~ Kiese Laymon, [Heavy](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3Dbca9d67867%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C490035991452412636ed08d966d731dd%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637653896702142325%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=02TTiHII2UwZswtnuL5fEuHhUwMcFLvKSGs7Z4v9Udo%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=bca9d67867&e=d0baf97615.
