  - > Believing that thereâ€™s a shortage of prosperity is a signal to think in terms of the inexhaustible Source: the Tao. Just like everything else on our planet, money is available in limitless quantities. Know this and connect to the bottomless supply. Do it first in your thoughts by affirming: Everything I need now is here. Prosperity thoughts are energetic instructions to access your infinite self, so actions will follow them. (location: 544)
