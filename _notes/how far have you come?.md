6 years ago I was happily single and envisaged staying that way
3 years ago I was a full time business advisor doing the whole hustle and crush it thing
1 year ago I lived in a suburban town

Then fast forward. 

Weâ€™ve now lived in the Derbyshire Dales, a beautiful and rural part of the country, for almost a year.
