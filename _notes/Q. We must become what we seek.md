We must become what we seek. So today I choose to become passion, I choose to be love, to be fearless in the way I love, and I choose to shine my light as bright as I can, for I am fearless, unwavering love and light. I tear down my walls and greet life with wonder and awe. I choose to lead with love and to make no apologies for it. I embrace the magic of this day, of this moment, of this breath. I am the dark winter and the glorious rainbows in spring. I am a stranger's kindness, a lover's touch. I am connected and aware of all that this moment offers. I select beauty as my focus. I am intimate, I am vulnerable, I am free, proud, fabulous, magnetic and radiant. I take risks, I am unapologetically me, and I refuse to let fear influence me. I choose to have memories, not regrets. I am magic, lust, enchantment, fascination and pure energy. I am fully alive. I am intrigue, mystery, excited and excitable. I vigorously drink in each moment. I will never allow my thirst to be quenched. I am the intoxication, the ecstasy, the pure, the truth and the adventure. I will never stop. I am here. I am now. I am divine love. Now and always. This is me. Creig Crippen ^26dbcc
