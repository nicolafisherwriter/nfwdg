# how a normal life kicks us in the seat of the pants

We always hope, after a big upheaval, change or shift, that life will revert back to normal. It becomes our goal, something thatÂ will signify that we've made it through and come out the other end.

But, life never returns to normal. Normality is only for the duration. Whatever has shifted for us has changed us, irrevocably. Our experience has taught us something new about life, whether or not we are cognisant of that at the time.

Navigating change is about releasing and letting go. An ending has taken place and there's no going back. We have to make room for the new.

Although we often resist change, it's where our greatest awakening takes place.Â  The old is being slowly wiped away, the new has yet to form.

Change opens doors, leads to new beginnings and transforms us, and our lives, in ways we might never have imagined.

Our losses are the catalysts that enable us to see ourselves more clearly.

Normal life, at some point, kicks us in the seat of the pants. It shifts us from where we are to where we need to be. We can either choose to embrace the change and move forward of our own accord or we will be pushed by some external force, whether thatâ€™s someone or something.

Change is an indicator that, somewhere in our lives, adjustments need to be made so that we can head in a new direction.
