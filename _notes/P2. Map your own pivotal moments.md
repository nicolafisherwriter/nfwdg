_Map your own Pivotal Moments_: look back at the endings in your life. They’re usually found in our losses, our loves or related to our life. Create your own timeline. See the connections and the milestones you have passed along the way.

How have these pivotal moments brought you here? How have you been shaped by some of your experiences?

Perhaps journal on these ideas. Or, if you’re happy to share your insights, add them here.
