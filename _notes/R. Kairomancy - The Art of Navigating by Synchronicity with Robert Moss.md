**Livestream via Zoom:**

**Kairomancy: The Art of Navigating by Synchronicity with Robert Moss**

**3 x 90 minute sessions, at 7pm BST over three Tuesdays**

-   Tuesday 15 / 22 / 29 June

**Real magic is the art of bringing gifts from another world into this world.**

  
We do this when we go dreaming and when we remember to bring something back. We can also walk the roads of everyday life as conscious or lucid dreamers, learning to recognize how the world is speaking to us in signs and symbols.

Through synchronicity, powers of the deeper reality come poking and probing through the walls of our consensual hallucinations to bring us awake.  
 

**Robert invented the word “kairomancy” to describe the practice of navigating by synchronicity.**

It builds on the idea that a key feature of the experience of meaningful coincidence is that we know this is a special moment when things operate differently. The Greeks have a word for a special moment of this kind. They call it a Kairos moment. Kairos is also a god, the antithesis of Chronos, the old god of tick-tock linear time. Kairos is jump time, opportunity time, the special moment you have to seize before it is lost.

**Kairomancy literally means divination by special moments.**

**In this 3 module online course with Robert Moss, you will learn:**

-   How to master the nine rules of coincidence
-   How to look for the hidden hand
-   The passions of the soul work magic
-   How to play street corner tarot
-   How to put your question to the world and receive guidance on a life theme
-   How to listen for your daily kledon, a favorite oracle of the ancient Greeks that works well on any day
-   How to recognize the archetypal forces at play in your energy fields, and how symbols that live in your mind have magnetic effects.
-   And much more!

**Come ready to play wonderful fresh games of coincidence in which you will receive direct messages on your life issues from the oracle of the universe.**

**Robert Moss** is the creator of Active Dreaming, an original synthesis of modern dreamwork and shamanism. A former lecturer in ancient history at the Australian National University, he is a best-selling novelist, poet and independent scholar.

**Using the Body to Release the Mind**

**with Carolyn Cowan**  
**Monday 24th May,  7pm  - 8.30pm**

**In this experiential session with Carolyn Cowan,  
we will explore the mind-body connection.**

How you think is in a continuous relationship with how you feel: sometimes conscious...for most of us, mainly unconscious. When you can bring awareness to this endless cycle you can begin to take ownership, to transform, and to change how you think and feel.

Carolyn will teach movement and breathwork practices to enhance your body-mind connection and alleviate stress and anxiety. You do not need prior experience, nor to be able to sit cross-legged on the floor. A chair is also perfect.

**Carolyn Cowan**  is a Psychosexual Therapist specialising in couples, pre & post natal, addiction, and trauma recovery. She is a Kundalini Yoga teacher and Teacher Trainer and run workshops in various subjects in the UK and abroad.  
 

**When:** Monday 24th May  7pm - 8.30pm

**Qigong for Emotional Balance**  
**with Ken Cohen** 

**Saturday 22nd May,  5pm - 7pm**

Does talking always solve a problem or does it reinforce painful memories, perhaps deepening old ruts of thought and behavior? Learn both theory and practices based on the qigong approach to emotional balance.

First we will learn how the body transforms the mind— simple postures that enhance grounding, well being, and slow respiration. Then Ken will teach you a seated qigong visualization that releases toxic emotional energy from the internal organs while recharging them with kindness and peace.

**Ken Cohen, M.A.** Qigong and Tai Chi Grandmaster has practiced these arts since 1968. He is the winner of the International Lifetime Achievement Award in Energy Medicine and is the author of The Way of Qigong.

**When:** Saturday 22nd May  5pm - 7pm
