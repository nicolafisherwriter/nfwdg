[My Life in France: The Life Story of Julia Child](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07H2N1CLB/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0)

I've only just started reading this book by Julia Child.

Recently I watched Julie and Julia again. Then a friend mentioned the new series, Julia, and the book, My Life in France.

I started reading the book and haven't been able to put it down. While Julia's life in Paris pre-dates my own by about 30 years, I recognise so much of what she mentions. Her love of France and all things French mirrors my own.

The book falls into the category of unputdownable. I find myself immersed in her life and memories of my own time there.
