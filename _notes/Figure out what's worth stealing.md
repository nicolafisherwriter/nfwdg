Every artist gets asked the question: "Where do you get your ideas?" The honest artist answers: "I steal them." ^409a6c

How does an artist look at the world? First, you figure out what's worth stealing, then you move on to the next thing. That's about all there is to it.

When you look at the world this way, you stop worrying about what's "good" and "bad" - there's only stuff worth stealing, and stuff that's not worth stealing. Everything is up for grabs...when people call something original, nine times out of ten they just don't know the sources involved.‚Äù
