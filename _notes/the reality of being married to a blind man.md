# the reality of being married to a blind man

One thing guaranteed to pull at my heartstrings is finding my husband sitting in a room in complete darkness.

Mostly, he switches on a light for Bamber, his Guide Dog. But on rare occasions, the reality of his life hits home.

## You'll have a smashing time!

When we first met I had a lovely blue mug, one of my favourites. Chris took it into his workshop one day, misjudged the distance and knocked it on the floor. Now he uses enamel mugs!

We had the saga of the escape peas. A bag of frozen peas all over the floor. Shortly after, a glass of wine. One day, just as I was about to leave for a meeting, I heard a smash - it was a bottle of milk.

We just mop things up. I clear away the glass.

## He misses nothing

Chris constantly amazes me. He is a Jedi hearing sounds long before I do. The blind have superpowers - they pick up on everything! Chris even knows when I'm wearing eye shadow - because he can smell it!

## Living life on the edge

People ask often whether it worries me that Chris is a Woodturner, using dangerous equipment. I say, No. If something happens, we deal with it. Like the time he fell down some stairs a couple of weeks after we moved to Derbyshire.

Chris won't be defeated - he has put up shelves for a friend when sighted men couldn't. He cooks, he does DIY, he woodturns.

He shows, every day, just what is possible. He's the most remarkable man I know.
