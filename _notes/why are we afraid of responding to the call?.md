>The problem in most situations is not a lack of calling; but a fear of responding to the call ~ Michael Meade

I became aware of something calling to me in my thirties. A deep sense of *there must be something more*. I had the fear too. Even though I didn't recognise it for what it was back then.

I still have the fear now. But I've come to realise that it will never go away. I must live with it and embrace it.

I wonder why we fear responding to the call. Is it simply innate fear or is it society's impact on us that makes us all want to hide. To respond to the call we have to put our head above the parapet and be seen. It's the being seen part that people don't like. We all have a unique genius but we want to conceal it for fear of ... being rejected, shunned, trolled.

So many of us don't live our own lives. We allow someone or something else to dictate how our life should be lived. Instead of embracing what truly brings us alive, we settle for the ordinary life. We don't consider ourselves worthy enough to have a life of our choosing.

We doubt ourselves, and believe that others are better in some way, more able, or more proficient. We believe that our skills don't stack up, often because they come so easily to us. But it's in those talents that come easily to us that we find our strengths.

We resist stepping out of our comfort zone and going with the flow. Afraid that we may end up penniless if we quit the rat race. We squash down all those dreams that nudge at us every day, and ignore them until some time ... later. And then later never comes!

We're afraid of razing everything to the ground, of burning bridges and losing it all. Loss is one of our greatest challenges. Not only does it mean we lose and have less but it involves change and we avoid that. The status quo is easier to live with even if it means being unhappy or wishing for more.

We don't want to have to start again. Fear of the unknown is worse than what we have now. What if it doesn't work out? Too many unfathomables.

Yet ... when people do launch into the unknown, they're most often surprised, finding themselves on a new path that they could never have envisaged.

All we have to do is take the next step in the knowledge that doors will open and the path will appear. And that we are equal to the task ahead of us.
