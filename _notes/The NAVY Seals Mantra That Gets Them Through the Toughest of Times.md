The NAVY Seals go through some unthinkably hard situations on a day-to-day basis. They’re almost too hard to comprehend. So, they need whatever tools they can rely on in real-time to keep them grounded, centered, focused, and alive.

On one of their now-famous missions, the NAVY Seals were out at sea in the middle of a huge storm. As it raged all around them, the sailors on board the ship had to grab on to anything sturdy, strong, and reliable as a way to survive while the captain had to stay true to his course even though he couldn’t see where he was going. There were no stars for him to navigate by or anything close to a landmass that he could use as a reference. All there were a few pieces of metal to hold on to and a compass to trust.

After the storm had passed and everything had settled down, a new mantra came to life and has come to define the mindset of a NAVY Seal. That mantra is — **hold fast, stay true.**

As the relentless storm furiously swirled around the NAVY Seals that day, thoughts of when will this ever end? Am I going to get through this? And I’m not sure I can hold on any longer must have passed through their minds.

However, sometimes all it takes to get through a situation is the ability to put one foot in the front of the other and accept that it’s still progress. At other times, it requires holding on for dear life while the adrenaline, the fear, and the anxiety show us that we’re still alive. And at other times, it can come via a simple mantra like hold fast, stay true.

This mantra and their now-famous [box breathing technique](https://medium.com/illumination/how-the-navy-seals-remain-calm-under-extreme-pressure-eed5719cdcde) have created rock steady, courageous, and unshakeably resilient NAVY seals. And when the waves are out of control and there’s nothing in sight to soothe their growing doubts, sometimes holding on to something steady and staying true to one’s course helps weather the storm just long enough to know that they’re going to survive.

These are the lessons that I’ve learned from this simple mantra.

The NAVY Seals only have two resources at their disposal at all times. Their mind and their breath. The lights might disappear at any moment, their bullets might run dry, they might lose their sight, or lose their fellow troops. However, their thoughts and their breath will go with them through it all. And it’s the same with every human being. These two resources are what we can all rely on from the moment we’re born to the moment we die.

The NAVY Seals choose box breathing as their breadth of choice.

Box breathing is a technique that is great for building emotional resilience, relieving stress, and for creating a calm inner state. **Its simplicity is its power.**

It has gained tremendous popularity in recent years ever since the NAVY Seals revealed that they use it to relieve stress in highly intense situations. It’s also a powerful technique for relieving anxiety.

-   Breathe in through your nose for 4–6 seconds
-   Hold your breath in for 4–6 seconds
-   Breathe out for 4–6 seconds
-   Hold your breath out for 4–6 seconds
-   Continue this rhythm for as long as needed

Box breathing is simple, easy to practice, and can go with through every situation in life.

Another fantastic breath to carry with you is rhythmical breathing. It’s very similar to box breathing so I’d love to share it with you here too.

Everything in life goes through a rhythm or a cycle. Some cycles move quicker than others so they’re more recognizable. Human life is shorter than a planet’s, for example, and a wave in the ocean is shorter still. The rise and fall of the moon, the cyclical nature of water, and the turning of seasons are other rhythms that life naturally goes through too. The breath is no different, it just happens more frequently.

The unique quality of the breath’s cyclical nature, however, is that its rhythm, speed, and intensity can be changed and altered to produce dramatically different experiences. Breathing in a smooth, consistent rhythm, for example, creates balance and harmony while breathing shorter, sharper breaths create stimulation and alertness.

Because all of life is in a rhythm or a cycle, when we breathe in a rhythmical way, we sync to the natural rhythms of life. The rhythm can change depending on if more or less energy is desired but by breathing in a rhythm we enter a state called heart coherence.

“Coherence is the state when the heart, mind, and emotions are in energetic alignment and cooperation. It is a state where there is increased synchronization and harmony between the cognitive, emotional and physiological systems, resulting in the efficient and harmonious functioning of the whole.” _— HeartMath Institute._

A wonderful by-product of breathing exercises that breathe in a rhythmical way is that we enter heart coherence naturally. Beautiful ripples (or waves) then start to radiate out from the heart as it signals to every other cell in the body to also become coherent. These waves move both vertically (up and down the body) and horizontally (out from the body), meaning that not only are these heart coherent waves healing for each individual body but that they are also healing to _everybody_ that is within that heart’s energetic radius. This has been measured to be as far as 10m outside of our body.

Imagine a huge ocean where wave after wave is of equal size and of equal distance apart so that the whole body of water is swaying and moving as one. Now imagine those waves as heartbeats — that’s heart coherence.

An incoherent ocean might have big swells or crashing waves.

Heart coherence is a personal and collective phenomenon that we personally and collectively move in and out of. On a personal level, we can often feel the collective energy when we walk into a room full of people. Sometimes it feels like there’s something in the air. That “something in the air” is the collective coherent energy of everyone’s heart frequencies merging together to either radiate a coherent or incoherent message. Our own heart’s intelligence then picks up on that energy and sends an incredibly fast message up to the brain that either compels us to stay and enjoy the beautiful atmosphere or get the hell out of there.

However, the challenge of heart coherence on an individual level is that each individual is either in or out of coherence depending on their emotional state of being from moment to moment. The same is also true of the collective heart coherence but an exciting aspect of the collective is that only a fraction of the population needs to be in coherence to influence the whole.

Exciting studies have been carried out over major cities across the world such as New York and New Delhi where small meditation groups gathered to meditate on peace. They collectively sat at the same time at different locations around the city with the intention to see if they could reduce crime rates, which they did with [surprising results](https://medium.com/change-your-mind/an-uncanny-social-experiment-that-surprised-the-world-465ecaed8cb6)**.** And this didn’t just happen once, this happened every single time they came together. That’s the power of living with an open heart. **Open hearts invite other hearts to open.**

1.  Breathe in through your nose (smoothly and without force) for 4 seconds
2.  Breathe out through your mouth (smoothly and without force) for 4 seconds
3.  Leave no pause at the top of the inhale or at the bottom of the exhale
4.  Repeat this breath for a few minutes
5.  Finish by holding your breath in for as long as comfortable
6.  Return to normal breathing.

If 4 seconds feels too long, try breathing in for 2 seconds and out for 2 seconds instead, or in for 3 seconds and out for 3 seconds until your breath naturally relaxes a little more. Then slowly soften your breath once you feel more comfortable.

As long as you breathe in a consistent rhythm without force, any rhythm is good. Your heart will know what to do next so it will naturally follow your lead and become coherent. Then, with an open and coherent heart, all of the health benefits associated with heart coherence will open themselves up for you to receive.

-   Decreases stress
-   Boosts energy levels
-   Creates balance and clarity
-   Enhances creativity
-   Builds emotional resilience
-   Creates less reactivity
-   Builds compassion, empathy, and understanding
-   Improves physical health
-   Creates better circulation & blood flow
-   Improves overall heart health
-   Soothes anxiety and depression

It really doesn’t take long to get into a state of heart coherence either. Sometimes only a few cyclical breaths is all it takes. But the longer you can stay there, the more coherently your cells, heart, brain, organs, nervous system will communicate as one unified organism. As one unified organism, communication then quickens so you can often feel more connected, open, and loving during day-to-day life.

So, if you are facing difficulty, stress, anxiety, fear, judgment, pain, or just want to become more grounded in the present moment, this simple breathing pattern can be a great tool to carry with you wherever you go. And no one even needs to know that you’re doing it either. It can be your own silent superpower that you carry within you to create more peace, balance, and happiness whenever you need to.

-   The NAVY Seals mantra is: Holdfast, stay true
-   Your thoughts and your breath are two superpowers that you carry with you throughout life — master them to master your life
-   Practice box breathing and breathe like a NAVY Seal
-   Breathe in a rhythm to open up your heart and connect to life
