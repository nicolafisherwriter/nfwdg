The reasons come back to 3 things: climate change, the pandemic and war.”

Climate change - lie
Pandemic - lie
War - lie

It’s all a put up job. 

Let’s put the fear of god in people. Let’s threaten them with war (death). 

Let’s threaten them with a virus (death).

Let’s threaten them with a dying planet (death).

Now we’re running out of fuel. So let’s make it scarce and very expensive. 

But … there is free energy. Why would we want that when businesses can’t make money from it?

This is like being in a film. Someone else is scripting it and we’re the extras. 

We’ve been told lies all along. Our lives have been wasted. In the name of money and commerce. 

In the name of lining the pockets of others. 

We’ve gone so far off track. Things are more important than people. Things are more important than truth. Than our souls. Than our essence. 

People are so brainwashed and plugged into the matrix that they can’t see any of this. It’s all portrayed as normal. But it’s not. 

They’re being controlled. They are slaves. They are worker bees for the masters who demand more and more, and laugh when the populace rolls over and falls into line.

If climate change was real, they would be doing something about it. 

Climate control is real. Weather control is real. 

It’s all out of a playbook.
