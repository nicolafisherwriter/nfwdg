Although I love books, these days I mostly read on my Kindle. Being able to carry around hundreds of books on one small device has always seemed like genius to me. I can even read using the Kindle app on my phone.

I still have a library of books, collected over the years and, every now and again, I'll find a title that needs to be read in hard copy. 

There are always several books on the go. I read according to my mood. Occasionally, there will be that one unputdownable book that demands to be read from cover to cover in one sitting.
