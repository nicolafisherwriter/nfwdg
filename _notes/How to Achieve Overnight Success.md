As I write this in 2021, we’ve had an amazing few months. Chris has been filmed by a production company for a BBC documentary, Blind Ambition, due to broadcast in July. A huge project, that has been almost three years in the making, is going ahead at the end of the month, and our involvement in another BBC project, Money for Nothing, has just got the go ahead. 

Chris’ work is now being displayed and sold in a gallery in Ashbourne, one of the goals on our plan for quite a while.

As things are coming to fruition, it’s easy to believe that all of these opportunities are by chance. That Chris has suddenly been plucked from obscurity. But they are all the result of six years of planning, dreaming and believing. 

While the end goal was always to spread the message that, whatever life throws at you, you can rebuild; to inspire and motivate people, and to share Chris' story of hope, we had a strategy behind the scenes to help us achieve that.

This is how we did it.

## Put your head above the parapet

If you want your work to be seen, you have to be visible. You have to be willing to show up. Chris is brilliant at this. Once I'd shared the concept of putting your head above the parapet, he embraced it. 

## Start small

We were thrilled by and grateful for every opportunity that came our way. Each one was a piece of a jigsaw. They helped us build our media page, be found on Google, and create credibility about Chris and his work.

We saw every new opportunity as another step up the ladder. 

## Network

Networking was my bread and butter when I worked in Manchester. I met hundreds of people and, at some point in our conversations, and when a natural opportunity arose, I would tell them about Chris. I shared his story. Often that would be the end of it but it was another person who knew of Chris. 

But, on several occasions it led to something more.

One of my clients, who we also commissioned to create the Blind Woodturner brand and logo, mentioned Chris to a contact at the BBC, which led to radio and television appearances, and put Chris on the BBC's radar.

On the strength of the initial BBC coverage, further content was published in outlets around the world. It was also the catalyst for other requests to film Chris.

## If you don't ask, you don't get

I've always been a bit brash about going after what I want. Mostly these have been experiences. I learned early on that if you don't ask for what you want, you're never going to get it. And, the worst that someone can say to you is no!

I was lucky to be part of a business community in Manchester where I met and worked with many different people. 

Once I got an idea in my head, I had to follow through. 

I’d come across an amazing guy called Chris Maguire who hosted many of the business events I attended. He could elevate even the most tedious topic with his wit and humour. He was also active on Twitter and, once, I was even included in the thank yous at the end of an event even though I had been in the audience! I'd tweeted how much I loved events hosted by Chris Maguire.

Yes, I meant every word but it was also my way of putting my head above the parapet. 

Come the day when I managed to speak to Chris and pitch him about the Blind Woodturner, I wasn’t completely unknown. 

From that conversation would come a podcast, a magazine interview and a short video.

And the start of the Blind Woodturner's public speaking career!

## Grab opportunities 

I’d spotted an event hosted by Chris Maguire about how to public speak and guessed, from previous experience of similar events, that there would be an opportunity for people in the audience to speak on stage. 

Chris and I attended. It was a great event. And then the moment came. I grabbed Chris’ arm and raised it even before he did. Chris Maguire had already been primed, and when he spotted Chris' arm in the air, he chose him as one of the speakers.

## Start from scratch

PR was never really one of my skills. I made it up as I went along. But I did research how to write a good press release and attended a workshop that still reminds me now to make it easy for the journalist.

## Be organised

Have examples of work to hand, short videos, social media posts that you can share. 

## Say yes to everything

In the early days, we said yes to every request. 

## Give it away



## Have a good story

It's pretty miraculous (or is it?) that Chris and I met. My skills complement what Chris does. I'm a Business Advisor, geek, website creator, planner and strategist, and someone who loves to write. But I'm also a huge fan of the Hero's Journey by Joseph Campbell and I soon recognised that Chris' story was an archetypal example. It became the framework that we used for the telling of Chris' story. We talk about essence. Chris is the most frequently used example when I talk about the Essence Map. He's such a perfect fit.

I remember once, probably before the Chris Maguire public speaking event, when we were in the car. In my inimitable style, I said, tell your story in 10 minutes. Go! We rehearsed many times after that in a slightly less on the spot manner!

## Do your own thing

We had no road map when we set out. We had absolutely no idea how things might evolve. And we had no aspirations for TV documentaries. We just hoped that more people, especially outside the woodturning community, would hear Chris' story.
