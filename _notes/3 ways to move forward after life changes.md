Following life changes, we naturally want to return to our default setting.

Whatever is _normal _ for us.

We hope that change will be temporary and, given time, life will go back to how it was.

However, we can never go backward, only forward.

## First we must navigate the Void

If you experience a loss, a pivotal moment or some form of change, here's why you will spend time in the Void before moving on again:

-   The Void is the bridge between what was and what will be

-   We adjust and regroup

-   It's an opportunity to release what no longer works for us

Being in the Void can feel hopeless but it's an important phase of the journey.

Here's how to make time in the Void work for you:

## Step 1: We begin to heal

Change and loss needs recovery time.

The Void is tailor made for this process. I recommend journaling. Although I've burned old journals, they helped me make sense of it all. A cafe, a latte and notebook, that's all you need.

## Step 2: Declutter and let go

I had many visits to the Void during an on/off relationship.

Each time I experienced an urge to purge my house. I decluttered so much it was a wonder I had anything left. It was cathartic. (What I failed to realise for a long time was what I needed to let go was the relationship!).

## Step 3: Be creative

It's in creative pursuits that we glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel.

Creativity helps us reconnect. We disengage from the thoughts spinning around our head. We find flow and, most often, insights.
