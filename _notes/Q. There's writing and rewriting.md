I have writer’s block all the time. But I write anyway. And I don’t mind - ‘Oh, this is crap!’ I don’t care. I can make it better, because I rewrite, so I can make it better. It’s two different ways of working. When I’m writing, it’s as if I am sitting in a garden, like a jungle where everything grows, and when I am rewriting, I’m riding on a horse through a field, brandishing a beautiful sword, the sword of…discernment, I suppose you’d call it… I am brandishing the sword, and there’s music, like Wagner playing… and I’m cutting everything that doesn’t belong. So there’s writing, and there’s rewriting. Don’t do both at the same time ~ Suzan Lori-Parks, [from her interview with the Academy of Achievement](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=843bda2639&e=eb9759f735)
