I was 51, happily single and my future was mapped out in front of me. Or, so I thought!

On 11th May 2015, I met a blind man. Three years later, we were married. As we like to say around here, I didn't see that coming!

## Life never stays the same.

After an 11 month marriage in my late twenties, I was single for much of my adult life. It wasn't the life I'd envisaged for myself, but I embraced it. By the time I was 50 and caring for my Dad, I believed my future was defined.

But life can turn on a dime. A chance meeting or phone call can change everything.

## 1. Live your life now.

For a time I was unhappily single. I longed to meet someone nice, be married, have children. That didn't happen. Instead, I had many other amazing adventures.

I learned to live the life I had and not hanker after another life that I thought I wanted.

## 2. Stop looking for something else.

When Chris and I met, we had both emerged from life challenges. We were each in a good place. And this is where we connected.

Focus on finding your centre because that's the best place to meet someone new.

## 3. You never know what the future has in store.

These last five years have been a whirlwind. We've crammed in so much, moved to the country, and are leading a life I never imagined.

Sometimes the best is yet to come. It's never too late, and you're never too old!
