It's Day 31 and, even though the ship has sailed, my urge to write continues!

My journey meandered through many different continents. I took several side excursions to remote islands. Now, I'm plotting my course more carefully for this next leg.

The first port of call has us exploring a gentler pace of life. More impactful for all its simplicity than you can imagine. These are practical and pragmatic ideas. Easy to make a part of your day.

### Why do we do this?

Living a gentle life gives us the time to tune in, realign and reconnect with ourselves. It provides us with space to regroup and to prioritise what's important in our lives.

We have an opportunity to dial down the outside noise and listen to the call of our own heart.

### You already know what to do

There's nothing new on the list of ideas I share. Many old favourites, often quoted. We are held back by a lifetime of expectations and a resistance to change. I act a guide, gently urging you forward to a life of your own design.

### I travel the same path

I am not perfect. I frequently fall by the wayside. I do this work as a reminder, as a nudge to live what I believe, and to prevent me defaulting to a previous setting. I believe: _you teach best what you most need to learn_.

### Join me
