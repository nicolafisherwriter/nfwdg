I’m on the verge of deleting all my accounts on Instagram. 

It gives me no pleasure. Perhaps I’ve outgrown it. Maybe I’m past it now. 

My feed is full of:

Someone I follow
Sponsored post
Suggested Reel
Suggested account to follow

Ad infinitum. 

I scroll through and very little sparks my interest. 

And I don’t say this to diss the people I follow. I think a lot of people feel the same way so their accounts are as neglected as mine. 

I have nothing to say on there any more. 

I’ve posted photos of lattes till the cows come home. And I’ve posted photos of cows too. 

There seems to be less and less engagement on Instagram. I find less and less to engage with. 

Instagram has become another messaging platform. I use it for very little else. 

So, I deleted the app from my phone. I’ve downloaded my data. I’m tempted to delete my account altogether. 

## what to do instead?

Twitter
Medium
Substack
LinkedIn
NotePD

## where to post photos?

I’m trying to find an alternative app where I can share photos. I crave the good old days of Instagram before it became commoditised and monetised. 

Instead of standing alone as Instagram, it’s competing with TikTok and YouTube shorts. Trying to be all things to all men. But it’s now a shadow of its former self. 

## niche

I think the secret is to niche. 

Coffee
Street art
Travel
Stationery
