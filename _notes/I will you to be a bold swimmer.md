Long have you timidly waded  
Holding a plank by the shore,  
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,  
To jump off in the midst of the sea,  
Rise again, nod to me, shout,  
And laughingly dash with your hair ~ Walt Whitman, [Song of Myself](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=0189d78818&e=eb9759f735)
