title: how and why I chose my word of the year for 2021

Inevitably, early on in the year I start to think about my plans. I’ve felt it more than ever this time around, I think, because of the _in between houses_ state in which we found ourselves. A form of limbo, a void.

David Barton posted on Instagram about his [word of the year](https://www.instagram.com/p/CJTrJyWgHw7/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). I’ve chosen a word for several years. In the past, I’ve had _renaissance_, _illumination_, and _joy_. They often proved to be rather apposite!

After reading David’s post I tried to recall my word for 2020. I had no idea! If I’d written it down, it was in a notebook stored somewhere in Leicester. And then it came to me! Duh!

At the beginning of last year I’d had my word made into [a bracelet](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/617021936/morse-code-bracelet-personalised). I had to check the order to remind myself of my word: _powerful_. I chose it to help me keep in mind that I was more able and capable than I sometimes believe.

I began to think about 2021. The follow up to an unusual year.

As I’ve mentioned elsewhere I’m a fan of the esoteric. I believe that our planet is at the juncture of massive change (but then you didn’t need me to tell you that!). The change we all see is a manifestation of a universal shift that is leading us down new avenues, if we all choose to travel in that direction.

It’s not especially unique but simply the outcome of the completion of one cycle and the beginning of another. It’s happened since time immemorial. This phase shows itself as chaos, a rocking of the boat, and stormy seas. In terms of the Essence Map, we’re in the Void right now wondering when the new Beginning is going to start. We’re in a no man’s land, no longer in the past but unsure of our future. As is always the case with Endings we’re in a state of shock, in need of healing and restoration, coming to terms with where we find ourselves, craving what we once considered to be normal but knowing, deep down, that the old normal is gone forever. We need to recalibrate, ready to emerge into our new Beginning.

(It’s a whole blog post altogether but I’ll be exploring how living at a gentler pace can help us navigate these choppy waters).

## sovereignty

For my 2021 word, I’ve chosen _sovereign_ or _sovereignty._

I toyed with a number of possibilities. But I kept coming back to sovereignty. I hesitated though as it seemed a little pretentious but it wouldn’t leave me alone.

Once I’d committed and purchased another bracelet, _sovereignty_ kept popping up in quotes, articles and blog posts. It seems that 2021 is the year for us all to be sovereign.

> _The word sovereignty means autonomy, independence, self-rule, freedom, supreme power and authority over oneself. Having personal sovereignty requires individuals to have integrity and to stand within their own power. Having sovereignty means recognizing that you not only own but also have responsibility for your Soul and your Soul’s purpose in this life. If you don’t have integrity, if you don’t live in your Truth then you are not ‘owning’ your Soul ~_ Joyce Lambert

To me, it’s a reminder that I can forge my own path, grasp the nettle, and be free to pursue my dreams. It’s about independence, freedom and autonomy, listening to my intuition and inner guidance, going within and hearing my own voice.

While we might be in a boat tossed about on stormy seas we still have control of the rudder and can learn to purposefully navigate. Despite appearances, we are the captain of our own ship and we can plot our own course. The journey is ours, we just have to choose it.
