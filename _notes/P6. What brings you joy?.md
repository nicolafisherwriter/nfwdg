A little like Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride, we often suppress our own preferences to align with others.

> IKE You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
> 
> MAGGIE Lost!
> 
> IKE That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
> 
> MAGGIE What!?
> 
> IKE With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
> 
> _Later in the film Maggie cooks eggs of every type and, finally, knows what she likes._
> 
> MAGGIE Benedict.
> 
> Ike has no response.
> 
> MAGGIE I love eggs Benedict. I hate all the other kinds.

Eggs might be a simple example but one we can all relate to.

-   Where do you compromise your own preferences? How can you do more of what you love?
    
-   To connect to our essence, we need peace and quiet to be able to listen to our own soul and intuition. My favourite way of doing this is to spend time alone in nature. Itâ€™s the best way to withdraw from the noise and busyness and quieten the mind.
    
-   Make a list of what brings you joy.
    
-   What is your taste in food, drink, films, books, art and music?
