Jimmy Kimmel said to Bill Murray: It seems like you just do whatever you want. That life is spontaneous. You go with the flow and great things happen to you all the time.  
  
Bill Murray said: Gilda Radner was rich so she would go into these auditions and not care at all whether she got them. So they were so dazzled by her lack of caring they would be dying to give her the role.  
  
He continued: So I figured, I’m not rich but I’ll just pretend like I am so I won’t care at all and see what happens and I’ve been doing it ever since.
