The world around us is an illusion. Itâ€™s a construct that we each create, based on our past conditioning and life experiences. It can be either a benign or hostile environment depending on our outlook on life.

Which means we can each create our own world. Simply by changing our thoughts. 

The starting point is decluttering. Letting go of thoughts, opinions, and beliefs that are not compatible with the type of world we want to create. This can mean restricting our inputs. To stop watching unhelpful television, to avoid the news, to actively seek out positive and uplifting inspiration. It may also involve distancing ourselves from others whose negative view of the world does not resonate with our own. 

Next, we prioritise. What is important to us? We must do those things more often.
