As I was writing a post recently, I looked for a reference to someone I used to follow years ago. It took me a while to remember his slightly unusual name.

When i found it, so much had changed. He was no longer offering intuitive work. His website had disappeared. I found him on Facebook, having pivoted to becoming a fantasy writer. 

He still had a Patreon account although most of his subscribers had unsubscribed because of financial issues, and he had lost the bulk of his income due to the pandemic.

I found a post where he talked about letting go, endings and new beginnings. And moving on to a new chapter.
