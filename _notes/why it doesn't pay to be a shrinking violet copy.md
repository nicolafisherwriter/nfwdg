My philosophy throughout much of my life has been that my work would speak for itself. That quality outputs would gain recognition based on their own merits. That actions speak louder than words.

It took me a long time before I learned that this was not the case. I watched colleagues gain plaudits while my efforts went unnoticed. It didn’t seem to matter how much I achieved, it was never sufficient to receive recognition. I found it massively frustrating.

The difference between me and my co-workers? They talked about what they had done. They didn’t leave anything to chance. They flagged up great client feedback, the project they had just completed, the ideas that they had. Meanwhile I was pulling out all the stops, unseen.

Chris is great at promoting himself and the work we do at [the Blind Woodturner](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk). He shares his story in a way that is compelling. He does it everywhere we go. I stand to one side and people either completely ignore me or ask me if I _help out_ or am I a lady of leisure?

I realised this response was part of the same syndrome that had frustrated me in my dayjob. People will conclude you do nothing if they have no idea what you do!

It really is no good hiding your light under a bushel.

My word of the year for 2021 is [Sovereignty.](https://agentlerpace.co.uk/word/) It means I am the captain of my own ship. I’m not dependent on others for their brickbats or bouquets. Given my personal history, it certainly makes sense, and has been one of those hurdles I’ve needed to overcome.

But, also, given where we’re at as a collective, sovereignty is key for us all.

The Essence Map is all about that route back to ourselves. The self that feels in alignment with who we are truly meant to be. The journey is about learning that there is nothing wrong with us. We are each a unique expression of the creative energy that drives the cosmos. We are not meant to be the same as anyone else. The purpose of our lives is to share the genius that is ours alone.

By sharing that genius, we encourage others to do the same. And that’s where the magic starts to happen. We light the touch paper for someone. We ignite the spark for them. And the ripples continue. I’m convinced that, the more we live in alignment with our essence, our blueprint, our genius, the greater our impact on the world around us.
