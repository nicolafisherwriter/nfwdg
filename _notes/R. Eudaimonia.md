Maybe you want to remember the memories you had with cherished friends and family, some of whom aren't around anymore—except in memory. 

Maybe you want to figure out how to go about living a good life—something the Ancient Greeks might call it *Eudaimonia*.

## Eudaimonic Happiness: An Alternative to Hedonic Happiness

>Recently, another approach to a good life has risen out of the historical and philosophical debris – the idea of _eudaimonic well-being_. Aristotle was the originator of the concept of [**eudaimonia**](http://positivepsychology.org.uk/psychological-adoption-eudaimonia/) (from daimon – true nature). He deemed happiness to be a vulgar idea, stressing that not all desires are worth pursuing as, even though some of them may yield pleasure, they would not produce wellness.

>Aristotle thought that true happiness is found by leading a virtuous life and doing what is worth doing. He argued that realising human potential is the ultimate human goal. This idea was further developed in history by prominent thinkers, such as Stoics, who stressed the value of self-discipline, and John Locke, who argued that happiness is pursued through prudence.

### Daemon

>Daimon refers to potentialities of each person, realisation of which leads to the greatest fulfilment. Efforts to live in accordance with one’s daimon, the congruence between this and people’s life activities, lead to the experience of eudaemonia.

### Csikszentmihalyi

>Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of _autotelic_ personality is also claiming its place under the eudaimonic happiness umbrella. Autotelic people are those who often engage in activities for their own sake, and experience flow states frequently.

>One problem with allocating flow into the eudaimonic camp is that some of Csikszentmihalyi’s characteristics of flow, including losing track of time and forgetting personal problems, seem to have much more to do with hedonic enjoyment than with eudaimonic endeavours.
