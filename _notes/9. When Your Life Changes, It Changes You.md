Spoiler: there is no such thing as normal. Once our life changes, there is no way back to whatever our normal used to be.

  

An Ending is like a new install of software. Some functionality will no longer work with this latest version. Hardware might become obsolete.

  

Everything has been reframed.

  

I always look for pivotal moments. Sometimes we can only see these clearly much later on.

  

I’m sitting here in Derbyshire because my Mum died in October 2013. This was the first of several pivotal moments and probably the main catalyst for everything that followed. My Mum’s death set in motion a series of events.

  

Two weeks later I sat on a sofa in a new build show house putting down a deposit on a house with my Dad. A year later I started a new job in Manchester. The following May I was asked to be a volunteer photographer at a charity event organised by one of my clients. 

  

That day I met a blind man called Chris. We became friends.

  

Just around the time that Chris and I began our relationship, my Dad died. 

  

Two years later Chris and I were married. The following year, I left my job paving the way that year for us to set the ball rolling for our move to Derbyshire.

  

It’s helpful to be able to look back now and plot the timeline of these pivotal moments. There is some sort of plan and organisation to the direction we take in life.

They’re usually found in our losses, our loves or related to our life. Create your own timeline. See the connections and the milestones you have passed along the way.

It took me a while to work out that those life changes had changed me. For at least a couple of years I tried to live as I had before. I’d failed to realise that I would need to adapt and change too.

  

Pivotal moments come in a whole variety of shapes and sizes. Some good, some not so good. All of these moments are messengers. They are the milestones that punctuate our journey and are there to teach us something of ourselves.

  

Pivotal moments are  transformational, putting us on a completely new path. Their purpose is to enable us to understand ourselves better. They show us glimpses of our unique essence. And help us to reconnect with the self we were always meant to be or wanted to be. 

  

Five years after my Dad died, the realisation hit. I was no longer someone’s daughter. That chapter was closed. A new journey had begun.
