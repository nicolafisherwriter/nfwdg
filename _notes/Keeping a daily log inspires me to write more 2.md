I’m late to the art of writing. Even though I’ve jotted for years, I never considered being a Writer. It was something I did in my spare time. It was a hobby.

So, I didn’t study writing. I never read Stephen King’s book On Writing. I didn’t analyse well known writers’ writing. 

I never knew as Deborah Levy suggests that a journal I kept in my twenties during a visit to Paris could become the material for a novel. Or that my daily logs could become a collection like Miranda Keeling’s book The Year I Stopped to Notice. 

The penny has finally dropped. There are so many ways I can repurpose the notes I’ve been keeping for decades.

I’m better equipped than I thought I was.
