I never thought I would be interested in writing fiction. I didn't think I had the imagination.

An idea popped into my head and I started a story called [[The Undertaker]]. I let my imagination run away with me and came up with a tale of murder and mischief.

Continuing the theme of death, one day I began pondering a system where people received a death certificate notification 48 hours before they died. I wrote [[Alice]]'s story and began writing a series. I may compile the stories into an anthology.

I have some other projects but they may need to wait for another day. I've realised that writing a book is much more time consuming than I imagined!
