My husband is the UK's only completely blind, professional, accredited woodturner.

We've followed a plan to grow his brand. This is how we did it.

## 1. put your head above the parapet

If you want your work to be seen you have to show up. Use social media to share your story and build your credibility.

## 2. network

Talk and tell your story. You never know who's paying attention.

## 3. if you don't ask, you don't get

Be brash about going after what you want. Doing this for Chris has led to speaking gigs, podcasts, interviews and videos.

## 4. dream big

Have a dream and a plan and then work your way through it. We're still doing that now.

## 5. start from scratch

Start where you are. Build as you go but have a bold plan of where you're heading.

## 6. be organised

When you're setting out is the best time to collate and build your story. Keep everything. It will create your back story.

## 7. say yes to everything

In the early days, say yes to every request. One thing will often lead to another.

## 8. give it away

Initially, most of what we did was unpaid. We gave away a lot of Chris' work too. It was an investment and has paid off in some way or other.

## 9. have a good story

Speak from the heart. Never doubt that you have a good story to tell.

## 10. do your own thing

You won't know the road map when we you set out. We made it up as we went along.

There is no overnight success! Put in the work and create the right conditions for your success.
