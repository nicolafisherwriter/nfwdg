- ü•© 1/ As the meat loses water, the flavor becomes concentrated.
  ‚úçÔ∏è Aging your ideas helps shed some of their superfluous attributes and concentrates the "flavor" of the idea. With time, ideas tighten up, and the insights underlying the idea become clearer. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484828003737605))
- ü•© 2/ Dry-aging breaks down the connective tissue between the muscle fibers.
  ‚úçÔ∏è When you first encounter them, ideas tend to sit within the specific context they were presented in and it's not always clear how they link up with your model of the world. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484829098446848))
- ‚úçÔ∏è Conversely, I've found that it's easier to connect older ideas to personal stories or anecdotes than it is to new ones. An aged idea sheds the initial context it was presented in and starts to connect itself to your stories and experiences. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484830230921218))
- ü•© 3/ You can control the aging environment to make sure the steak doesn't spoil. 
  ‚úçÔ∏è You can't just dump your ideas in a damp, dark corner of your mind and expect it to work out. You need to treat the idea right. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484831401078788))
- ‚úçÔ∏è Depending on what the idea is, it could be seeing how it sits alongside other wins, or it could be airing it out through a conversation with a friend. The environment around the idea is how it will take on flavors unique to you that give your ideas your signature texture. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484832537800705))
- ü•© 4/ There is a sweet-spot for how long to age the steak for. 
  ‚úçÔ∏è Ideas can go stale if left for too long. Revisit an old journal and Ideas and insights that once seemed revolutionary to you, can now seem pedestrian. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484833569599492))
- ‚úçÔ∏èThere is a sweet spot for how long you should let your ideas sit, but really, only you know when it's ready. ([View Tweet](https://twitter.com/DrErnestLim/status/1453484834643341316))
