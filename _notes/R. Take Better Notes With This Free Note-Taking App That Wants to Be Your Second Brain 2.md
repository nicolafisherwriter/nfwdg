[**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/) might be _the_ note-taking app we’ve been waiting for.

It wants to be your second brain. It lets you capture your ideas and take notes in text (Markdown) files (also check out this [collaboration app](https://ausius.medium.com/a-free-and-powerful-app-to-help-you-collaborate-effectively-b7e3ae011e0b) that has built-in Markdown team wiki), and most importantly, it easily connects your notes and visualizes connections among them. It’s perfect for discovering insights from your notes. It’s also free, so you have little to lose if you try it. And if you use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) on macOS, check out my [Alfred Obsidian workflow](https://github.com/hauselin/obsidian-alfred).

It’s made me rethink [why we take notes](https://medium.com/swlh/why-take-notes-3-common-misconceptions-and-3-better-mindsets-447ef6853aa9) and completely changed [how I take notes](https://medium.com/@ausius/how-to-take-notes-insights-from-ai-neuroscience-a-sociologist-and-a-free-app-34b4be63080a).

I’ve been using Obsidian for over two weeks, and I only love it more each day (I’m not affiliated with the developers). Other apps like [Zettlr,](https://www.zettlr.com/) [RemNote,](https://www.remnote.io/homepage) [Notion,](http://notion.so/) [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/), [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink?pk_campaign=google&pk_kwd=devonthink1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwupD4BRD4ARIsABJMmZ88TjNhAiIh6ZKPYyX4amrsGbHEi-HPlpajuiUz6EfvHCo8g1JFyb0aAn1NEALw_wcB), [Tinderbox](https://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/), and [Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/features) also have similar (and additional) features, but they aren’t free and lack a [community](https://obsidian.md/community) as active as Obsidian’s. To add icing on the cake, the developers are very active and responsive too. Learn more about the developers’ design philosophy [here.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23324598)

It’s available for macOS, Windows, and Linux, making it an excellent substitute for online apps like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) (another new and popular note-taking tool), which costs $15 per month and only has a web app — which has had [data loss issues](https://twitter.com/roamresearch/status/1257440829427376128) recently. If you like VSCode, check out [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/), which is like Obsidian, but works in VSCode.

Obsidian’s **Markdown editor** is incredible. The screenshot above shows you what it can do: blockquotes, inline code, code blocks, to-do/task lists, images, links, footnotes, math equations, and even highlighting and [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/). The Markdown editor has two modes — edit and preview — and the team is [working on](https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap) a WYSIWYG editor (e.g., [Typora](https://typora.io/)).

Its **note multiplexer** is also fantastic for viewing or editing multiple notes at the same time (and works like other [multiplexers](https://medium.com/better-programming/code-and-develop-more-productively-with-terminal-multiplexer-tmux-eeac8763d273)). You can split the panes vertically or horizontally, and it feels like I’m using a powerful text-editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Vim. In fact, it supports Vim key bindings too, which matters to me because [I’ve recently become a Vim user](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-ive-learned-after-using-vim-15-days-straight-ceda7e773a6d).

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/features) wants to be your second brain. It accomplishes this goal by adopting the philosophy of “**link as first-class citizen**.” Individual, unconnected notes are useless, so Obsidian focuses on connections and links between notes, **mimicking the billions of neural connections in your brain**.

You can easily connect and create new notes by typing `[[`, and you’ll be able to navigate your notes like a knowledge wiki, using links and backlinks. You can also add tags with the `#` sign.

> The human brain is non-linear: we jump from idea to idea, all the time. Your second brain should work the same.
> 
> In Obsidian, making and following \[\[connections\]\] is frictionless. Tend to your notes like a gardener; at the end of the day, sit back and marvel at your own knowledge graph. — Obsidian

For example, if you have the following text in a note — “according to Sapiens, the three revolutions are cognitive, agricultural, and scientific” — and you want to create a new note named Sapiens, you simply type `[[Sapiens]]` to link your current note with the new note Sapiens.

Obsidian is also designed for those who want to use the [Zettelkasten note-taking system](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) or [one-note-per-thought](http://www.dansheffler.com/blog/2015-08-05-one-thought-per-note/) methods (see [here](https://zk.zettel.page/) for more resources for the Zettelkasten system; compiled by [Reddit users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/)). However, you don’t have to use any system with Obsidian because it can flexibly adapt to any note-taking system.

Obsidian wants to help you gain insights from your notes and connect those insights. Once you have connected your notes with links and backlinks, you can visualize connections between notes with the **graph view**.

The graph view feature is handy for identifying loner or outlier notes. When I see such notes, I’ll spend some time thinking about how I can link them with my existing notes — especially with the “super-connector” notes in my graph — to ensure my web of notes is well connected.

Another cute feature is **showing a random note**. I haven’t used this feature much yet because I currently don’t have too many notes. I think showing random notes in a random order might be a great way to find new connections between these notes.

I can also imagine the utility of this randomness a few months or years down the road. It could remind me of the notes I’ve been ignoring.

I think the graph view and random note features can really help to connect ideas and discover insights and new connections from your notes.

Obsidian doesn’t store your notes in a proprietary format. It’s all just plain text Markdown. Your notes and attachments (e.g., PDFs, images) are saved in a local folder, and you can sync it to any cloud storage.

Like many powerful text editors, Obsidian comes with a handy Command Palette that lets you perform many actions without leaving your keyboard ([people who use the Vim editor](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-ive-learned-after-using-vim-15-days-straight-ceda7e773a6d) think the mouse is their mortal enemy). If you don’t like the default keyboard shortcuts, you can change them very easily.

Obsidian currently has 18 core plugins that make the app more powerful. Allowing users to build their plugins to extend Obsidian might be _the_ feature that makes the app powerful and long-lasting. Many well-designed apps become very popular over time because they are highly extensible: [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) productivity app for macOS, and text editors like Visual Studio Code and Sublime.

![Obsidian custom and community themes](https://miro.medium.com/max/2168/1*YMXXWZ3slnZJqUky5cS3Jw@2x.png)

Screenshot of Obsidian’s [Tweet](https://twitter.com/obsdmd/status/1275945678506770433) and more themes can be found [here](https://github.com/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian).

In addition to the plugins, you can also fully customize Obsidian’s color scheme with your own custom CSS or you can use one of the community themes, which you can find in Obsidian’s settings or on [this Github repository](https://github.com/kmaasrud/awesome-obsidian).

Obsidian is very new. It’s still beta software, so you should expect to see bugs occasionally, though I haven’t had any issues yet. Because I like it a lot, I’ve become a [supporter,](https://obsidian.md/pricing) which means I have access to the latest updates, builds, and developmental features. I started using Obsidian only recently, but the app has already been updated twice, and “insiders” like me even have access to features like [mermaid Markdown](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/) flowcharts.

Some users have complained it’s an [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app (yes, you can toggle developer tools and try cool stuff if you want to fiddle with the app), which means it might sometimes use a little too much computer memory or RAM, though it seems like the team has been actively trying to solve these problems. Again, I haven’t had issues with RAM usage yet.

Currently, there’s no built-in sync (though you can sync your notes to any cloud storage) or collaboration, but the team plans to implement these features in the future. These additional features, however, will not be free.

There’s no mobile app (yet). So for now, many users are using either [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) or [1Writer](https://1writerapp.com/) while waiting for Obsidian to release their own mobile app.

Obsidian’s popularity has grown exponentially in the last few weeks, and many Roam Research users have also migrated to Obsidian. Many people are discussing the app on Reddit and the [community is very active](https://obsidian.md/community) (in fact, users on Discord have helped improve this post!). You can also find many tutorials on YouTube.

The team is very transparent about their [progress and plans](https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap) on Trello. They’re also incredible at addressing bugs and responding to feature requests.

I’ve used [Bear](https://bear.app/) as my note-taking app for many years and I’ve wished it could help me better connect my notes and ideas. I think Obsidian might be the app I’ve been waiting for. It might be a very new app, but it feels like a lot of thought has already gone into the design process, and I think it’s worth trying. I think it’s already changed [how I take notes](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-take-notes-insights-from-ai-neuroscience-a-sociologist-and-a-free-app-34b4be63080a) and [learn](https://medium.com/@ausius/2-meta-learning-principles-to-help-you-learn-more-efficiently-44061c9951e1).
