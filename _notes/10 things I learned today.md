## My notes

Make it into a book?

1: Your skills/experience can improve someone's life
I helped out a lady in the village today. She had some IT issues and I volunteered to give her some tech support. She coordinates some local updates and, for months, she had been sending out emails, one at a time, to her subscriber list. A low tech mailing list and an Outlook group are going to make a big difference. It was simple for me but a game changer for her.

2: You never know what impact you have
A new friend of ours came to visit while I was out. Like Chris, he's an aviation geek, and an air rifle fan. Chris loves spending time with him. Our friend said how much meeting us had given him a boost and spurred him on to do more. All we've done is drink tea/coffee and chat.

3: If something's not working, change it
I've been serialising a book I'm working on and trying to write it in a linear fashion. I got stuck a few weeks ago so I've decided to write it all out of order. Thinking of a big edit as well.

4: Sitting on the garden bench in the sun with Chris
After our friend left today, Chris and I sat on the garden bench for a while. It was lovely and sunny. We just chatted about our day and the conversations we'd had. Nothing major. Simple pleasures.

5: Seeds take longer than you think to grow
I've been waiting for signs of the seeds growing. I had almost given up when I spotted a tiny cluster of shoots the other day. Today I saw some more and my beloved Chocolate Cosmos is making an appearance.

6: I need to up my idea capture
Life is always ebb and flow for me. I have periods when I'm massively productive and creative, and then other times when my head feels as if it's full of cotton wool. My idea capture has decreased and I need to refill the well. I wonder why I go round in the same circles!

7: Tech makes me happy
I love playing with tech, experimenting, making things work. My free Obsidian publishing solution makes me very happy.

8: The goldfinches hang out on our roof
As we were sitting outside, I spotted a pair of goldfinches hanging out on our roof. Normally I'm birdwatching from inside the house so never seen them do this before.

9: A new location changes your life
Moving house to Derbyshire has made a huge difference. We are becoming part of this community in a way we never were when we lived near Manchester. We love it!

10: Finding a new dentist is incredibly difficult!
Because we moved to a new area, I need to sign up with a new dentist. Tried today and none of the ones I phoned are taking on new patients!
