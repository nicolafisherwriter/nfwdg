As a freelance creator it’s hard to do everything yourself. Sure, there’s plenty of freedom and joy that comes with autonomy, but that trusty list of todos is usually longer than the day.

One thing we can’t leave off the list, is self-promotion. No matter what kind of day we have.

If we don’t promote our own work no one will see it. Sure, you’ll get the occasional word of mouth, but if you want your creative practice to grow in a meaningful way, you need to tell the others.

**In walks Medium.**

Writers. use their Medium accounts for different reasons. I prefer to use Medium like 1,300 little employees. A tiny army of free labor (save for the time spent to write the story), all in your corner, working tirelessly to help grow your practice.

**Medium is a great platform for self-promotion.**

All the tools are here. They make it easy to share every piece of content on the socials. And you can Tweet just about any little piece of content you make.

> All lanes lead to the list.

**What do I mean by this?**

Let’s return to the mini-employee analogy: If you write a story once, with only the intention of earning a couple pennies through the partner program, that story has a finite life and has done little-to-nothing for the growth of your creative business.

Flipped, if you use the _all lanes lead to the list_ approach, each time you write a new piece of content you’ve hired another micro-employee in your marketing department.

Medium is a horrible (I mean horrible) vehicle for direct sales. I.e. you ask people to buy your stuff at the bottom of your story, or inside story links. I’ve tested this in many ways.

**Yes, I’ve sold a handful of course through direct links here, but the alternative is so much better that direct-selling isn’t worth your time.**

If you want to hire your next mini-employee, include a link to join your email list at the bottom of every. single. story you write. Not just a couple. That’s like needing 150 employees for a job, hiring three, saying “that should do it,” and wiping your hands… later, wondering why your list didn’t grow.

**On Medium, it’s really hard to retain a reader, using the platform-alone.**

Someone might love your work, but if the go click-happy down some other article rabbit hole the algorithm will stop feeding them your stories. Even if they love your work.

**In many situations you’ve got one shot to retain a reader — ONE.**

So, you have a choice: You can earn two cents from that single interaction, or you can have your entire team of mini marketing employees gently encourage each new reader inside your fence.

When you have a reader on your email list you now have the ability to contact that person any time you have something to say.

Where, a Medium reader might literally be worth two pennies to you, over their single-article relationship with your work, that same reader as an email subscriber might be worth $1,500 over her lifetime with you.

**It’s time to look for some ‘new hires.’**

I challenge you to begin thinking of each Medium story as a tiny employee for your creative practice. You’ll get much more value from your writing time this way.

Plus, all these little employees work for you while you sleep (and while you’re awake, but while sleeping sounds cooler).

**When you’re ready to start your email list I’ve got something for you…**

I built [**a free email masterclass for you**](https://www.subscribepage.com/tribe1K) (my link, away from Medium)**.** I hand-crafted the whole thing, by hand… with my hands. It took me a couple months to build the first version (many revisions since). I call this masterclass the _Tribe 1K_.

**Now is a great time to start (or grow) your email list.**

I’ll show you how to get your first 1,000 (or your next 1,000) readers without spending a hot nickel on ads. Past Tribe 1K students include _New York Times_ bestselling authors (yep, the ones you see in the bookstore), high-caliber university professors, attorneys, doctors, scientists, artists… and regular folks too — just like you and me.

**Your email list will help you build freedom through your creative work.**

If you want to grow your creative business you need email before you lose that valuable reader’s attention. A social media account isn’t enough. Start your list before you need one. Once you _need_ a list it’s almost too late.

We’re waiting for you.

**My Tribe 1K Email Masterclass is a $97 value (with all the templates and checklists included) and it’s all yours here.**
