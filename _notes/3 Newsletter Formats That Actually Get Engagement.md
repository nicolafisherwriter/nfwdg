There’s a growing epidemic of clunky newsletters that leave me no choice but to click ‘Unsubscribe’.

A typical email newsletter comes in three to five sections that include any of the following:

-   A short story
-   A list
-   A GIF
-   A link to a resource or tool
-   A quote
-   A call to action

As a busy person subscribed to about ten newsletters, I won’t have the time nor the patience to read all sections. And here are three reasons why:

## **There are too many ideas in one place**

Unlike a well-written article no more than 1,000 words long, there’s no sense of coherence. I feel the need to click the links and open new tabs, which ruins the reading experience. If I do it, my head feels full — the kind of full where I read so much but fail to absorb anything.

## **It’s all about _your_ product**

Mr./Ms. Creator, I get that your newsletter is a channel for you to get clients, and I respect that. What puts me off is when you plug your product too early, or too often. The genuine truth is, I subscribed to you because, in your Call-to-Action (CTA), you promised to help me. If you do that first before asking for anything in return, I will naturally give back by recommending your content to my friends, engaging with your posts online, and eventually buying a product that is a good fit for my problem.

## **It takes too long to get to the point**

Concise writing is the marketing skill of the century. Tell me what you want to say in one sentence. Don’t waste my time with the line-by-line hype-building. I especially don’t like it when you do this to create a hook for **your product** in the end.

Okay, you might say I’m not the ideal audience because I wouldn’t buy from you _right away_, and that’s true. But here’s also why you’re wrong.

You underestimate the potential return from building a long-term relationship with me, a.k.a. my customer lifetime value. You underestimate the word of mouth I could pass on. You underestimate the potential friendship that could blossom into a fruitful partnership. You underestimate the potential of becoming a top-of-mind expert in my head. You underestimate the life you could have changed, which _should_ be more rewarding for you than any monetary value. You’re a creator who constantly evolves and God knows what you’ll be writing about next year, and I would gladly ride that journey with you if you had built a relationship first.

I guess it boils down to the breadth of your vision and a greater sense of purpose. Are you after the money, or are you here to make a difference in my life? I think the most successful **and happy** creators get this right.

OK — End rant. Enough about the things I don’t like. Let me share with you three email formats that actually get me reading until the end, and even make me **love** the person who sent it.

Here’s a sample from

’s newsletter:

An email from [Tom Kuegler](https://findingtom.com/)

Of course, he didn’t tell me to sign up for life updates, but after he delivered on what he promised (a 5-day email course), he started sending these. And I actually enjoy them.

You might think, _who would want to read about life in Mexico?_ I do! Because it’s such a breather from the information-rich emails I’ve been receiving. It’s like a letter from a dear friend. And it works not so much because it’s human, but because it stands out.

Here’s a sample from

’ Career Caster newsletter, made for aspiring podcasters:

The first half of an email from [Nasos Papadoulos](http://www.metalearn.net/)

The formula? **Story (x) Concepts (x) Compelling Insight.** The concepts are woven into a story, and the story, delivered line by line, naturally leads to one compelling insight (not in the picture). It’s non-skimmable. It’s the kind of stuff you usually see go viral on LinkedIn, but slightly longer.

There were no links in the email body, which got my eyes following down until the end where a non-disruptive P.S. CTA waits:

The CTA in an email from [Nasos Papadoulos](http://www.metalearn.net/)

is also very intentional. Although his word count is usually over 500, he writes in such a compelling way and delivers value sentence after sentence, so I’m going to make him an exception. He understands a key principle in thought leadership: **give value first, and the herd will come.**

The CTA in an email from [Tim Denning](https://timdenning.com/)

No plugs, just an occasional P.S., which is even in favor of the reader. Amazing!

My favorite newsletter by far is [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/subscribe/)’s.

He publishes daily articles that are no more than 150 words and distributes them by email.

An email from [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/)

He offers one thought for me to ponder throughout the day. It’s like a sprinkle of pixie dust.

In an era of lengthy newsletters offering a barrage of information, the way to make an impact is to write short and strong.

-   Spread yourself too thin, and you lose your audience in the process.
-   If you’re talking to smart people, don’t insult our intelligence with colors, pictures, emojis, buttons, and tons of links.
-   Stand out by contrast, _not_ by clickbait.
-   Weave your insights into a story. That’s how we learn best.
-   Say your message in the shortest possible way.

Great marketers don’t appear like they’re marketing. They don’t ride with the trends. They rise **above** the trends, seeing what is rarely being done while everyone’s head is stuck in the sand.
