  - > Actually, those who were praying weren’t praying for patients who were infected in 2000. Instead, unbeknownst to them, they were praying for lists of people who had been in the hospital from 1990 to 1996—four to ten years prior to the experiment! The prayed-for patients actually got better during the 1990s from the experiment conducted years later. Let me say this another way: the patients who were prayed for in 2000 all showed measurable changes in health, but those changes took effect years before. (location: 560)


  - > our intentions, our thoughts and feelings, and our prayers not only affect our present or future, but they can actually affect our past as well. (location: 565)


  - > the quantum field doesn’t respond simply to our wishes—our emotional requests. It doesn’t just respond to our aims—our thoughts. It only responds when those two are aligned or coherent—that is, when they are broadcasting the same signal. (location: 602)


  - > The quantum field responds not to what we want; it responds to who we are being. (location: 605)


  - > field. The feelings we generate magnetically draw events back to us. Together, how we think and how we feel produces a state of being, which generates an electromagnetic signature that influences every atom in our world. This should prompt us to ask, What am I broadcasting (consciously or unconsciously) on a daily basis? (location: 610)


  - > our routine, known thoughts and feelings perpetuate the same state of being, which creates the same behaviors, and creates the same reality. So if we want to change some aspect of our reality, we have to think, feel, and act in new ways; we have to “be” different in terms of our responses to experiences. We have to “become” someone else. We have to create a new state of mind … we need to observe a new outcome with that new mind. (location: 621)


  - > Once that match exists between who we are being/what we are broadcasting and the electromagnetic potential in the field, we will be pulled toward that potential reality, or it will find us. (location: 626)


  - > To change your life is to change your energy—to make an elemental change in your mind and emotions. (location: 630)


  - > If you want a new outcome, you will have to break the habit of being yourself, and reinvent a new self. (location: 631)


  - > These manifestations should leave us with no doubt that our consciousness made contact with the quantum field of intelligence, so we are inspired to do this again. That is the joy of the creative process. (location: 658)


  - > change your internal environment—the way you think and feel—and then see how the external environment is altered by your efforts. (location: 666)
