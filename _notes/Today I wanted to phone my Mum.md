It was only a fleeting impulse. It popped up out of nowhere and was gone as quick as it came. But it was there. A thought. *I could just ring my Mum.*

That hasn't happened for ages. Perhaps it was stirred up by writing about [[Chesters]] yesterday, and reminiscing about out trips there.

It's funny (peculiar not ha ha) when it happens. Grief is an extraordinary experience and process. For me, it peaked and then, very slowly and very gradually, began to tail off until I was no longer ambushed by tears. People talk about absorbing grief somehow. It becomes a part of you. Yes, you learn to live with it in a *life will never be the same again* way.

And every so often it highjacks you, coming in from left field. A reminder that the connection still exists. Perhaps it's them nudging you from the au-del√†.
