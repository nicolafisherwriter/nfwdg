I first came across Instagram when Susannah Conway started talking about the app many moons ago. At that point I didn't have an iPhone and Instagram, in the early days, was only available on iOS. Being able to access the amazing photos, and sharing all that colour and creativity was a big driver for me to acquire an iPhone.

I suspect Instagram was the very first app I downloaded. It was everything I hoped for, an outlet for my own photography, a source of inspiration, and a way of finding community.

I loved Instagram for a long time.

But, at some point in the past year or so, I've fallen a bit out of love with the square photo app. Did the tide turn when Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 or later, in 2018, when the co-founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, departed Facebook? I'm not sure but there's been a shift somewhere along the line. And, from what I've been hearing, I don't think I'm the only one feeling this.

I used to love sharing the photos I'd taken when Instagram was truly a photo sharing app. After a day out with my camera or my iPhone, I'd be itching to upload my favourites, document what I'd been up to or showcase the place I'd visited.

Then, increasingly, Instagram shifted from being a personal app to a business opportunity. More and more people (me included) used it as a tool to promote their offers, products and services. Yet it still worked. It became fascinating to see the creative ways others would use the app to sell their wares.

The sense of community remained. Now we followed others because they were on our wavelength or their work was helpful to us.

And then things changed.

Scrolling through my Instagram feed now, there are fewer pretty pictures and more text, adverts and how tos. I'm spending less time on Instagram (perhaps that a good thing!). I can go days without posting Stories and it's a few weeks since my last post.

I know I'm a contributory factor too. Looking at my own grid, there are more words and fewer pretty pictures.

I don't yet know what the answer is - it's something I've been mulling over for a while. When I've worked it out, I'll let you know!

But, let's talk about Twitter! Some time ago I deleted my Twitter accounts. I had several thousand followers on each - one was more personal and the other had been used for work. I'd moved on and relocated, and the content appearing in my timeline was no longer relevant.

Plus, Twitter had become quite contentious (it still is) and some of the spats were appearing in my feed. I reduced my following to a handful but still I saw content that didn't appeal to me. So, I hit the delete button.

It was when I started my obsession with Obsidian that I was drawn back into Twitter. A lot of the personal knowledge management (PKM) discussions were taking place there. So, I set up [a new account](https://twitter.com/liveagentlelife). I only follow accounts talking about Obsidian, PKM, writing, Napkin, Second Brain or related topics. And Richard Feynman.

So far, so good. What I'm seeing is very specific and relevant. And it's been a revelation. I didn't think I would enjoy using Twitter again.

Why does it work better now? I think I've found my niche. By being specific and clear about my interests, I've come across others who are going down the same rabbit holes. We're probably all a bit eclectic in what we find fascinating, and much of what people share appeals to me.

Perhaps social media goes in waves. Maybe Twitter is on the up again and going through something of a renaissance. Instagram may have that yet to come.

Twitter also seems to be experimenting with new offerings. They had Twitter Fleets which didn't take off and that function has now gone. They've linked a newsletter function to accounts. Called [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) (and acquired earlier this year), it's similar to Substack. Subscribers can sign up from a link in your Twitter profile and you can compile emails using content from Twitter, Pocket, Facebook, Instagram, Medium et al. Yes, of course I signed up! [Check out my profile here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/liveagentlelife).

I'm going to be using it as a round up of weekly Twitter content and for more ad hoc updates.

You might have heard me mention Clubhouse towards the end of last year. Twitter now has its own audio gathering tool call Spaces. You can start or schedule a Space, invite speakers and guests, in a very similar way to Clubhouse. Twitter might have an advantage because each account has an established audience and, hopefully, shared interests.

Twitter seems like it might be back in the ascendant, for me anyway. I'm certainly spending more time on there at the moment than on Instagram. Will that change? Only time will tell.
