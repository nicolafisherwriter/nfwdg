[This isn't the first time](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/regrouping/), and I'm sure it won't be the last, that I have felt a nudge to regroup, recalibrate and realign. In many ways it's been the story of my life. Often triggered by a definitive ending such as bereavement, job loss or relationship breakdown, this time it's emerged out of nowhere with no apparent catalyst.

But first, let's talk about irony!

As many of you know, the core philosophy of my work is living at a gentler pace. Lately I've had a few comments about how busy I seem to be, and how my life doesn't appear to be in alignment with what I advocate.

I completely agree. And I suspect that some of the nudges to regroup stem from this lack of alignment.

I feel those times when I am out of kilter. They niggle at me. They always have. Why? Because my flow has gone. Everything feels more like I'm pushing a boulder up a hill rather than the ease of being in flow.

I asked the question on Instagram whether people sensed a change was coming for them and 100% of the answers said Yes! Perhaps this is a collective experience as much as an individual one. I've mentioned elsewhere that we are at [a pivotal moment](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/world/) as a planet and this is, of course, affecting us all.

It can seem inconceivable that we are in the midst of a global shift. We spend much of our lives embracing our perception of normal but this is not normal.

I started reading about the coming shift many moons ago. Probably around my late twenties. I spent Saturday or Sunday afternoons browsing the Mind Body Spirit section of Waterstone's, not knowing quite what I was looking for or why I felt this fascination.

In my thirties, I came across Reiki and embarked on a course to learn Reiki I. Convinced that I had all I needed, I had no thoughts of taking it a step further. I can only describe what happened next, perhaps 18 months after completing Reiki I, as a nudge. It was as though some external force was urging me on. So, I spent a weekend being attuned and came away with a Reiki II certificate. I was definitely done now. Especially as Reiki III with the same teacher involved going to Stonehenge and wearing white robes. One robe too far for me.

Another couple of years passed, and the nudges began again. I found a very practical teacher who didn't advocate the wearing of white robes, and two of us were attuned that weekend. It didn't qualify me to teach but that was fine. Teaching was never in my plan. Until it was! Yes, more years passed and the nudges began again. This time, and by now in my mid forties, a friend and fellow Reiki Master taught me what I needed to know to teach.

I don't think it was by chance that I went down this path.
