We have to look at our own inertia, insecurities, self-hate, fear that, in truth, we have nothing valuable to say. It is true that when we begin anything new, resistances fly in our face. Now you have the opportunity to not run or be tossed away, but to look at them black and white on paper and see what their silly voices say. When your writing blooms out of the back of this garbage and compost, it is very stable. You are not running from anything. You can have a sense of artistic security. If you are not afraid of the voices inside you, you will not fear the critics outside you ~ Natalie Goldberg, [Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=cde0f945c6&e=eb9759f735)
