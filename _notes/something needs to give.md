I preface much of what I say with this caveat: I have a simplistic view of the world. But, you know what? I think simple solutions work.

As I write this, Sri Lanka is in debt, printing money to pay staff and probably run out of petrol. Watch this space as similar scenarios play out elsewhere.

The natural world is designed to meet our needs. This planet's eco system is designed to support the life that inhabits it.

What it's not designed to do is to support our capitalism and materialism.

We have everything we need, not necessarily everything we want.

For some time I've thought that we've dug ourselves into a hole. Instead of climbing out, we've kept on digging. 

The political world is structured to keep us wanting more and to tell us that there is not enough to go round. Someone will have to do without. Not the 1% at the top, though. They will never go without. They will survive, at our expense.

There will come one gigantic and global pivotal moment. We've already seen the signs. We've felt the nudges. Now we're waiting for the kick in the seat of the pants.

Much of the world we inhabit is fake. It's a sham. Man made. Money. Religion. War. Always with an agenda behind it. Nothing is ever what it seems.

Politics is not about what's best for the people. It's about power and money. Politicians wanting power and money.

How many truly have your best interests at heart?

A complex web has been spun drawing together those who want to promote their own interests - the media, the news corporations, pharmaceutical/fuel/arms businesses. They're not interested in peace or people. Just how much more money they can make at the expense of we, the people.

Life was never meant to be like this. Someone, somewhere had a vision and started to build it. They created a military industrial complex. They pitted countries against each other. They promoted war. Not wellbeing.

We're at the end of this game now. But how will it end?

Global financial collapse (followed by a global reset which merely restarts the game with new rules).

Nuclear wipeout (followed by ... ditto. The elite will have travelled off world to ensure their survival, if not yours).

If our soul purpose is to experience joy, to come to a deeper understanding of who we truly are, we've selected a hard way to do that.

Trauma and grief teach us tough lessons. I've moved forward the most by experiencing these.

But there is a far gentler way. And that's the one I imagine.

It will mean transforming the way we live. Impossible you say? The planet was transformed for two years by a pandemic. So global transformation of an altogether more positive epidemic is entirely possible.

It requires a group of people to decide that something has to give. To start the ball rolling. To create that ripple effect. 

It begins with each of us. What do you want for your life? How do you want to live?

Do you want to live in constant fear of what the news reader tells you is happening around the world? Or, do you want to choose a different way?

It's all illusion. Nothing is as it seems. We just have to choose which illusion we want to build.
