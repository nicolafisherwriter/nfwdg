Visibility. It’s the word that makes my heart sink to my feet. The bane of my life, it haunts me.

[**You have to speak for your work**  
_Hello One of my greatest challenges is visibility. Over the years this has got worse rather than better. I've operated…_nicolafisherwriter.substack.com](https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/p/you-have-to-speak-for-your-work?r=o42hc&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web "https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/p/you-have-to-speak-for-your-work?r=o42hc&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web")[](https://nicolafisherwriter.substack.com/p/you-have-to-speak-for-your-work?r=o42hc&s=w&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)

I wonder why I find it so hard to be seen. And, from the outside looking in, others appear to find it much easier.

My husband, Chris is great at promoting himself and the work we do at [the Blind Woodturner](https://theblindwoodturner.co.uk). He shares his story, without hesitation, in a way that is compelling. Ironically, in the early days, I coached him on how to put his head above the parapet!

#### people will conclude you do nothing if they have no idea what you do!

I’ve been a shrinking violet for much of my life. I’m practical and pragmatic. I get the job done without fanfare. Dependable and reliable, that’s me.

I was inspired this week by [Patricia Ross](https://medium.com/u/1c6fa441f4cc). Now 83, I suspect she’s the type of woman I would like to be, both now and at her age. Like two of our friends, Annie and Jennifer, also octogenarians, feisty, with extraordinary stories, and still devouring life with both hands.

Reading Patricia’s article made me want to write my own version. So, here it is.

#### about the real me

I’m 58. I’ve managed people, products and projects, living and working in London, Paris, Amsterdam and Manchester. My big love is technology and anything geeky. My second, speaking French.

I was an only one, born in Manchester. My Mum was a medical secretary and my Dad an electrical engineer. My Mum really wanted me to be a doctor. That was never part of my plan.

At 18, I moved to London to study French. I spent a magical year in Paris at the Sorbonne, emerged with a DAFA (Diplôme Approfondi de Français des Affaires), and having met Bill Murray. My dissertation was about the marketing of Coca-Cola, then approaching its 100th anniversary, and provided the research for an article published in Madame Figaro.

After Paris, I lived and worked in London, speaking French in a couple of jobs. My London life came to an end when my boss, Bill died, aged 56. This, and an attempted kiss by a much older man, proved to be a pivotal moment which led me back _up North._ Just for a month to regroup.

But, within a couple of weeks I’d met the man I would later marry. We embarked on a relationship strewn with red flags which I chose to ignore.

The day before my 30th birthday we got married, and I left a month before my 31st.

I spent the rest of my thirties immersed in work, commuting up and down the country, working a lot in London. The internet was emerging and I wanted in. I took up a series of internet-related roles as the bubble grew and then burst.

In one job I travelled to Amsterdam every week, staying at the [American Hotel](https://americanhotel.com-amsterdam.com/en/), which I loved.

Mid thirties, I came up with an idea for a charity book and wrote to 800 celebrities asking them to contribute. 120 did. The launch was held at the Groucho Club. Alan Titchmarsh, James Herbert and Katie Fforde were among the guests.

Photography became a passion. I did some training with [Brett Harkness](https://www.brettharknesstraining.com/), bought new lenses, and photographed people and weddings.

In my spare time, I walked for hours with my camera photographing trees and documenting events in the city centre. One day I photographed Tony Benn, George Galloway, Bianca Jagger during an epic marathon run around town when they attended a protest march.

Snapping the snappers

Later I photographed Lee Rigby’s funeral. Taking place in the church where I got married, somehow I kept my prime spot in the shade despite police moving everyone else on, and the press pen being located to my right in the blazing sun. Lined up behind me were several secret service guys (the Prime Minister attended), wearing sunglasses and chewing gum. Not one person challenged me.

After the funeral, I turned a corner to find a row of the press photographers sitting on the ground. [One of them](https://joelgoodman.net/) allowed me to watch as he filed his photos and chatted to me about his process.

Yes, it was a terrible occasion. And also a day I will remember for so many different reasons.

Lee Rigby’s funeral

At 38 I took up kickboxing and finally found a sport that I loved. I trained every week for the next twelve years.

I first met my boxing hero, [Chris Eubank](https://nicolafisherwriter.co.uk/eubank), at a car showroom. Eighteen months later I met him again. I had started kickboxing and he signed one of my gloves. He remembered me as soon as he saw me, strode over and gave me the biggest bear hug.

In 2015 I met a blind man. Three years later we got married, and I became his wife and Business Manager.

Signing the register

Nudged by the untimely death of someone we knew, I quit my job as a Business Advisor and Mentor. Another pivotal moment which freed us up to sell our house, up sticks and move to Derbyshire to start living my dream life in the country.
