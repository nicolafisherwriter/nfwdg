## Highlights
- There are more secrets to be revealed now in blood types and bloodlines than we can possibly figure out. The struggle for dominance will reflect the research and development into DNA that has been going on for years, both human and nonhuman. That research will now reach deep, deep, deep into the past and into the human consciousness.
    - Note: So change the configuration of blood. Conceal the bloodlines. Conceal those who have bloodlines of which they are unaware. Tamper with DNA. Alter consciousness.

  So David Parral is doing rite of passage, and he shared a video called info capture which is just so enlightening, and he's shown me several other ways of saving information which is just genius. As this whole knowledge management stuff is so amazing because it is really the missing link between reading ideas, writing from abundance and sharing ideas and writing, and all these different bits of technology that joined together, just completely fantastic and game changing as this otter, which I'm using now.
