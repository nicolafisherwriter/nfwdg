<p>I&#8217;ve been fascinated by online business for well over a decade. I&#8217;ve watched people like <a href="https://www.daniellelaporte.com/">Danielle LaPorte</a>, <a href="https://www.marieforleo.com/">Marie Forleo</a>, <a href="https://leoniedawson.com/">Leonie Dawson</a> and <a href="https://www.susannahconway.com/">Susannah Conway</a> create businesses from scratch. I&#8217;ve followed them and tracked their evolution over many years. I asked myself the question: if it was possible for them, was it also possible for me?</p>



<p>Over the years, that question has always been at the back of my mind.</p>



<p>A Gentler Pace was never meant to be an all consuming enterprise but, inadvertently, I lost my way and started down that path. I planned and strategised, I blocked out my calendar with tasks to be completed, I tried nearly all the to do apps to improve my productivity. I had 12 week plans, 12 month plans. I listened to webinars, I joined Facebook groups. I wrote copious notes of all the things I needed to action. It evolved into yet another full time job, albeit of my own making, and I wandered further and further away from my original dream &#8211; to live at a gentler pace.</p>



<p>Of course, it was all going to come to a head, at some point.</p>



<p>Interestingly, I&#8217;ve come full circle. I&#8217;m back now where I started out when I first came across <a href="https://helenredfernwriter.com/">Helen Redfern</a> and had an aha moment. Someone was doing what I dreamed of. Someone had already made that a reality. I remember looking at Helen&#8217;s website and her Instagram, and just having a moment of absolute resonance.</p>



<p>I wonder why we over complicate life. Perhaps we get sidetracked by the shoulds and losing sight of our own ideals.</p>



<p>As I sit here now with my revised plan, and one very similar to <a href="https://helenredfernwriter.com/blog/how-i-plan-my-creative-projects-and-tasks-for-the-month">how Helen plans her weeks</a>, I feel lighter. I realise how much pressure I had put on myself to do it all. Worse still, for someone who values truth, I was looking to others for inspiration &#8211; but people whose journeys, hopes and aspirations did not mirror my own.</p>



<p>It has taken me a while to realise that this wasn&#8217;t the life I had set out to create.</p>



<p>Now I&#8217;ve pressed pause, I can stop and look at all of this with a degree of detachment. As I wrote in my last post, I&#8217;ve been a big fan of burning my bridges. It seemed to be the answer when I was stuck and had hit a brick wall. Today I&#8217;m looking at it slightly differently.</p>



<p>Instead I&#8217;ve been thinking in terms of ships and sails. I believed I knew where I was heading but found myself sailing off course. I needed to adjust my sails and plot a new course. (Note the contrasting analogies of fire and water!).</p>



<p>The destination remains the same but I&#8217;ve been on a surprise adventure in uncharted territory. I&#8217;ve learned a lot along the way including how it feels when you&#8217;re lost. And how different it feels when you find your way again.</p>



<p>I can breathe. I&#8217;ve exhaled a deep sigh of relief. It&#8217;s only now that I can fully appreciate how hard I&#8217;d made life for myself.</p>



<p>No experience is ever wasted. I&#8217;ve written words that can be re-purposed. I&#8217;ve made friendships with people I might not otherwise have met. I&#8217;ve discovered concepts that I can use in other contexts. I&#8217;ve worked out what I do and don&#8217;t want.</p>



<p>I think, most importantly, I&#8217;ve learned something new about the route map that I follow. That obstacles in our way don&#8217;t have to mean the end of the road, but simply indicate that we&#8217;ve gone down the wrong path. A lot of what we might be doing is right, we just need to regroup, take a few steps back and recalibrate.</p>



<p>Perhaps all that is needed is an alternative perspective, one that shines a light in a dark corner where some other treasure is hiding.</p>
