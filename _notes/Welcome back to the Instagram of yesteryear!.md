The main reason I bought my first iPhone was Instagram. I wanted the app. And to join Susannah Conway et al who were talking non stop about the ‘gram and busy building their glorious grids.

Photography has always been my creative outlet. The scroll fest of beautiful images was inviting. I wanted to join in the party.

In those early days I shared my best and favourite photos. Instagram became a photo journal, tracking me as I wandered back streets of Manchester in search of grunge and street art, logging the lattes I drank, and showcasing my favourite stationery.

Online friendships grew as I connected with others via shared hashtags.

#### nothing stays the same

Subtly and without fanfare, the app evolved and changed. There were still pockets of pretty pictures but, now, it was a business promotion tool.

Last year, I noticed something was amiss. The algorithm was possibly a factor. A lot of people seemed to have jumped ship or had gone AWOL.

Then there was another group. Those who had fallen out of love with Instagram. I realised I had too.

#### give me back Instagram 1.0

All the initial joy had been sucked out of Instagram. Taking photos had become another task on the to do list, secondary only to sharing a message. Posts had to be purposeful, hashtags curated. Reels were de rigueur.

Towards the end of 2021 I realised I was done with this version of Instagram. I wanted Instagram 1.0 back.

#### all or nothing

First, I archived every post. My grid was empty. I deleted my bio. And it felt good!

My default setting is always all or nothing. For a few days I toyed with deleting my account altogether.

#### back to basics

Gradually, a different plan formed. I unarchived some old posts. Pretty pictures of the photo journal type. Nature photos, pictures of trees. I added a few words to my profile.

From now on, there would be no posting schedule, no content plan, no strategy. I would post when I felt like it and then just everyday photos. Nothing fancy, nothing contrived.

I might add some hashtags. Or I might not. Instagram was for me now, to reconnect with those heady, early days.

#### surprising results

My follower numbers had plateaued for the best part of a year. Engagement was negligible. Comments few and far between.

Once I started my new policy, my follower numbers slowly began to go up. The posts I share elicit increased interaction.

I like the look and feel of my grid these days. It’s more me. I’m treating Instagram as a behind the scenes glimpse into my life and loves. It’s working much better this way.

And, it’s almost like the good old days again!
