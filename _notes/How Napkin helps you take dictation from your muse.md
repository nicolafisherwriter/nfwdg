*And how I capture ideas anytime, any place, anywhere.*

Today, I stood in a queue for almost an hour. Facing me was a screen playing a slideshow. The content prompted some thoughts so I took out my phone, opened up the [Napkin](https://medium.com/u/42ce0231aec7) shortcut and started typing.

These fleeting thoughts would have been lost if it hadn’t been for [Napkin](https://www.napkin.one/). In the past I would have promised myself that I would remember my ideas later. Yes, I could use Obsidian or a notes app. But Napkin is friction free at the idea capture stage. It’s perfect for recording thoughts on the fly.

Then, back at my computer, those thoughts will be there, in my Napkin inbox, waiting for me to retrieve them.

I scan and action each of them. Are they part of my Daily Log? Or an article idea? What tags should I use?

Quickly and easily done, those ideas are recorded, searchable and actionable.

#### writing anytime, any place, anywhere

Napkin is central to my goal of being a Writer.

I can write even when I’m spinning plates. I can log ideas on the hoof.

Our life is often famine or feast. Weeks are crazy or calm. Writing, for me, always required swathes of uninterrupted time. I needed to find my flow, to dive deep into that creative well. I don’t always have that luxury now.

I’m learning, slowly, how to write, block by block. I’ve adopted a more modular approach. Articles write themselves in a paint by numbers style. I concentrate on the different colours in turn until the picture becomes whole.

I daydream as I sit at the back of village halls, watching Chris give a woodturning demonstration. My mind wanders. I contemplate my latest draft article, make up stories about other members of the audience, or create characters for my fiction. Discreetly, I jot notes on my phone.

#### café au lait by

Here in the Derbyshire Dales, I love to get a takeaway coffee, find a layby and set up the Car Café. I’ll sit, alone, taking in the view, not thinking of anything other than the beauty around me. As thoughts start to pop into my head, I catch them in Napkin. I sit there, happily chatting away into the app.

I sit in car parks. Either before or after doing the weekly food shop. I log an idea that occurred to me on the drive there or as I pushed my trolley around the supermarket.

As I walk the local lanes, I can stop for a moment to add inspiration to my Napkin.

I stand in churchyards making notes. I whip out my phone at the drop of a hat to consort with that pesky muse.

#### entertain your muse

It reminds me of a story I read years ago. [Told by Elizabeth Gilbert about Tom Waits](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/06/12/elizabeth-gilbert-nypl/). This is what she said.

> He [Tom Waits] was caught in traffic. He had one song, and he talks about songs that you have to bully and songs that are like dreams through a straw, and then this one: He said that there are songs that don’t want to exist, and you have to let them go, and you have to let them not haunt you — which is another way to not become insane as an artist. And he was driving down the freeway one day in Los Angeles, and he heard a little tiny trace of a beautiful melody, and he panicked because he didn’t have his waterproof paper, and he didn’t have his tape recorder, and he didn’t have a pen, he didn’t have a pencil — he had no way to get it.

> And he thought, “How am I going to catch this song?” And he started to have all that old panic and anxiety that artists have about feeling like you’re going to miss something, and then he just slowed down and he looked up at the sky, and he looked up and he said, “Excuse me, can you not see that I’m driving? If you’re serious about wanting to exist, come back and see me in the studio. I spend six hours a day there, you know where to find me, at my piano. Otherwise, go bother somebody else. Go bother Leonard Cohen.”

Now, I no longer think, _how am I going to catch this idea?_ I pull up the Napkin shortcut on my phone and save it right there.
