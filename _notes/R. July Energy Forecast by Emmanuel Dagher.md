**Exciting Changes**

You may have noticed that the curtains that once hung in front of humanity’s eyes, keeping us from fully seeing beyond those primal veils of illusion, are now being pulled back, and more quickly than ever.

People from all walks of life are noticing that their consciousness is expanding into new ways of thinking, living, and being. Time is speeding up, and the world is shifting at lightning speed.

**Here are some specific examples of the “pulling back of the curtains” happening now:**

**Governments and other organizations are releasing and legitimizing documents and knowledge** about other-worldly technology found long ago that far outruns the current capabilities of human logic and technical know-how.

For many of us, this doesn’t feel like big news, because we’ve known this was coming for a long time. Because of all the noise going on right now, it may be harder to take seriously these monumental shifts, and to see their significance.

**Meditation has become mainstream**, and is being used as a powerful tool for healing and personal growth. Not only in people’s personal lives, but in the workplace, health-related organizations, schools, and beyond.

A decade or more ago, if you had told someone who wasn’t familiar with the mind/body/spirit community that you were meditating, well—you probably would have seen a blank, glazed look in their eyes, at best.

**The demand for organic, sustainable, non-GMO foods and products** is so high, the supply can barely keep up.

New farmer’s markets and health-oriented stores and restaurants are opening up everywhere, creating options for people to take good care of themselves from the inside out.

**People are realizing that they can no longer give their power away** to institutions such as religion, government, or any of the old power structures that promote suppressive, fear-based agendas.

Of course, there’s still room for improvement in this area. Yet the speed with which things are changing is awesome to witness.

**Caring for the environment is continuing to be a priority** like never before, with people beginning to create new ways of cleaner, more sustainable living that are more beneficial for our planet, and all of her citizens.

**The consciousness of humanity as a whole is evolving beyond the old patterns** of living in separation from one another.

No matter how much the “noise” tells us otherwise, when we drop into our hearts, we can feel it.

Again, there’s always room for improvement. Yet the big strides are taking place, and shifts are happening everywhere.

**Every few months, we hear about a new “Earth-like” planet** that has been discovered in a far-off galaxy that “could” be a home to other civilizations.

**Western medicine practices are increasingly acknowledging and integrating** natural and holistic approaches and methods, more than ever before.

There’s also a great deal happening in the areas of technology, creative arts, and personal well-being. But the examples offered above offer a clear picture of how quickly we are evolving.

If you are someone who gets all of your information from the news and doom-and-gloom social media content, almost none of the things mentioned above will seem to be happening in your world.

**This is because we experience and even become what we focus most on.**

If you are finding it hard to stay optimistic during these changing times, be gentle and kind with yourself.

It just means that on some level, you’ve been giving your power away without even realizing it.

**You, at your core, are not a pessimistic person. By nature, you are a free, powerful, peaceful, loving, and optimistic being.**

So if you are not feeling this way, know that it might be time to get clear on who and what you are devoting most of your time, energy, and attention to.

And that it might be time to get clear on whether or not you desire to continue giving your power away.

**You have the power to choose what your energy is focused on, though the mind will try to convince you otherwise.**

For the next 30 days, just take 3 minutes every morning and every night to connect with your inner self. Let yourself turn off all outside noise and distractions, and begin to feel into the peace underneath it all.

The more we connect to this wellspring of inner peace, the clearer the world around us becomes.
