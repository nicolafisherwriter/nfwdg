Sergio Magana, a shaman in the Aztec tradition, calls the years 2012 - 2021 the transition between the Age of the Fifth Sun, a “Sun of Light,” and the Sixth Sun, a “Sun of Darkness.” As Magana writes in his book, **The Age of the Sixth Sun**, the nature of our collective reality subtly transforms as humanity moves into the Sixth Sun. During a Sun of Darkness, what we experience as reality becomes more psychically malleable, more dream-like. As he told me in an interview:

The four ages oscillate between Suns of Light and Suns of Darkness: The Sixth Sun is a Sun of Darkness. This is not good or bad. “Darkness” means what is unknown: our shadow, the dream state, “the cave.” In Nahuatl tradition, we have the “tonal” and the “nagual.” The tonal is who you are awake: who you are reflected in the obsidian mirror. The nagual is our essence, energy body: who we really are. On the way to our essence, we find the dream state and the dream body. In the Age of the Sixth Sun, we have to learn the science of dreaming – we have to take control of the nagual. Everything can be done in the state of the nagual.
