The kindest people are not born that way, they are made. They are the souls that have experienced so much at the hands of life, they are the ones who have dug themselves out of the dark, who have fought to turn every loss into a lesson. The kindest people do not just exist - they choose to soften where circumstance has tried to harden them, they choose to believe in goodness, because they have seen first hand why compassion is so necessary. They have seen first hand why tenderness is so important in this world.
