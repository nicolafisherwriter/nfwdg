Hello Nicola,

Going with the flow or surrendering to life’s plans for us often come through big events like job loss, illness, the death of a loved on, or as we’ve seen this past year, in the shape of a global pandemic. Which means we may find ourselves on a detour, experience delays or have things removed from our lives and the change of plans may make us feel like we have no control in a particular situation.

It's in those moments we must practise silence, so we can be guided by our own SST and allow something new to emerge.

This week, spirit tells us the energy is asking us to Clean and Clear (see below)... so just what needs to be released as you surrender your plans Nicola?

"Let it go, let it go, let it go. Release now what is not coming with you into the future, into the beginning that is emerging for you. Let go of the heaviness, the baggage, the old. Actively work to clear your space, your mind, your body and emotions, your energy, for there is much beginning to make its way to you now. Are you ready to receive it?"

Affirmation: _"I easily release on all levels all that is no longer for my highest good. I clean and clear in order to manifest and welcome the new"_

August's energy forecast includes themes of timing, surrender and allowing things to coalesce in the ether, before we see and potentially understand them in the physical, earthly plane.

But how do we find the balance point between planning and surrendering?

In today's episode, we go explore how we can:

-   Find the balance between our rational and intuitive mind
-   Surrender our plans to something much bigger than us
-   Trust life is working for us
-   Trust our own inner wisdom
