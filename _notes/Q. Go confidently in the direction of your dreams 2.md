I learned this, at least, by my experiment; that if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours. He will put some things behind, will pass an invisible boundary; new, universal, and more liberal laws will begin to establish themselves around and within him; or the old laws will be expanded, and interpreted in his favor in a more liberal sense, and he will live with the license of a higher order of beingsâ€¦If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under them ~ Henry David Thoreau, [Walden](https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=88c9ac4706&e=eb9759f735)
