What would you think if you heard that the next Buddha/Christ was waiting for the right time to present His credentials & speak to humanity - in a super powerful way where everyone would hear His words loud & clear in their native tongues (no translators necessary) while simultaneously causing everyone on Earth to feel around 10x more love than they've ever felt?

And what if someone told you that this titanic being, who is known/awaited by many names, had talked to Executives at BBC in London about 35 years ago in multiple meetings. The executives liked the idea of giving him some time on BBC to speak to the world, but at the last minute, they asked the Queen (head of the church of England) about it. Her religious authorities nixed the idea, concluding that it could not be true - that if it were true, He'd surely approach them first... not the BBC.

BTW, that situation has much in common with this story within a story of ~140 years ago:

"The Grand Inquisitor" by Fyodor Dostoevsky (1880)

Lucky for us, He is more interested in helping the people of the world, than helping the ruling elite cling to power.
