## My Note

The Hero's Journey takes us on a quest. Perhaps to foreign lands. Real or imagined. Perhaps the foreign land is simply undiscovered parts of us. We have to go on an actual or metaphorical journey before we can return to ourselves and see the place for the first time.

The Essence Map, conceived in my forties before I'd come across the Hero's Journey maps the route I took as I nevigated 

When we see life as a journey, we become a play

Life is a journey and we are journeymen and women, on a quest to make sense of the world around us and our own life. Our journey can be real or metaphorical. We may travel to foreign lands. We may excavate parts of ourselves there. Ultimately, we journey home again to see the place and ourselves, as if for the first time.
