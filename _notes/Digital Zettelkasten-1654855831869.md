## Highlights
My digital Zettelkasten allows me to seamlessly engage my thoughts with a high-powered database of the most interesting things I’ve read or thought – things I know I know, but which are just beyond the reach of my consciousness. It’s what productivity consultant Ari Meisel would call an “external brain.” — location: [67](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=67) ^ref-13554

A Zettelkasten – especially a digital one – is a bicycle for the mind. — location: [70](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B095VY4XGD&location=70) ^ref-29901
