When we resist our lives, we create greater separation from the truth of who we really are. The more separate we feel from our true Self of love and joy, the more powerless we feel, and the more powerless we feel, the more we suffer. We are inviting you to demonstrate your love for yourself by waking up to your own power. Accept that no one and no thing outside of yourself can ever steal your peace or your joy ever again. Itâ€™s not about what has happened to you, it is how you decide to respond that determines the quality of your life. This is your life, and only you are in control of how it is experienced. Although it may be uncomfortable at first, the truth will set you free ~ excerpt from The Inner Work book
