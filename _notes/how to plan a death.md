As a family, we were always pragmatic. My Dad, especially.  Over the years my Mum would remind me where to find their Wills. She would advise not getting rid of all their things when they were gone. The only thing my Mum didn’t help with was her funeral. She just didn’t want to be buried. 

When she died in 2013, my Dad and I contemplated and pursued various options for scattering her ashes. All of them fell through. One day my Dad said, let’s go to the Lake District and scatter her ashes there. 

So, we did. Somewhere near Windermere where my Mum and Dad honeymooned. 

Two years later, to the day, I returned with my Dad’s ashes. To scatter them at the same spot.

One day, my ashes will be scattered there too.
