# myth - Obsidian is too complicated. Not if you think of it as a house!

I’ve been a fan of Obsidian since April 2021 when I first heard about it. I stayed up late into the night learning about potential setups. I experimented with plugins. I organised my folders and my tags. I watched countless explanatory YouTube videos.

I was aiming for the perfect setup.

Spoiler: there isn’t one!

Over the past months I’ve talked enthusiastically about the game changing nature of Obsidian. Friends have wanted to know more. I’ve taken them on a 5 minute tour using Loom.

And then they all say … it looks very complicated!

#### let’s think of Obsidian as a house

Imagine the house building process. First, the foundations are laid. Then the walls and the roof trusses. For a long time a new build is a shell. Just a framework.

Plasterboard goes up. Rooms start to take shape. Bathrooms and kitchens are added. Then you move in, and make it your own.

Obsidian is like that.

When you first download Obsidian, you’re working with the plot of land where your house will be built.

You create your first Vault — the repository for your first notes. This is your foundation.

Next, you decide on the framework. Is it going to be open plan with all your notes in one place, just tagged? Or, will you create rooms — or folders — to store all your thoughts?

#### like Rome, a house is not built in a day

Construction takes time. Creating your Second Brain on Obsidian is no different. There’s a step by step process.

You also get to choose what type of house you’re building. Will it be a modest house or a multi-room abode with every bell and whistle conceivable?

With Obsidian you can be anywhere on the continuum from newbie to full on geek.

#### are you a minimalist, an organiser or a hoarder?

Some home owners prefer lots of empty space. Then there are those who have everything in its place. Others like to have, gathered around them, precious items collected over a lifetime.

Which are you?

I’m an organiser. I like a place for everything. I love logic and my on and offline systems reflect this. My current setup consists of neat folders, each with a clear purpose, cross referenced with tags.

Like possessions in your home moved from one room to another, notes can be relocated to different folders.

#### making it your own

Settling into a new home takes time. First, you unbox. Often, short on space, boxes take a tour around the house until you decide where their contents will go.

Getting started with Obsidian is no different.

You may be importing data from Evernote, Roam, OneNote. What worked in Evernote may need some tweaks in Obsidian.

My Obsidian setup has evolved multiple times as I’ve moved notes around until I found a _look and feel_ that felt right. I tried other recommendations which were great as starting points but then I had to make it my own.

#### a house is always a work in progress

So is Obsidian. It’s an ongoing build.

Some years you may redecorate, buy new furniture, add on an extension.

I’ve overhauled my Obsidian setup, tried a new theme, installed new plugins.

Once a house is built, it’s much easier to see the potential changes you want to make. The same is true with Obsidian.

#### don’t try to keep up with the Joneses

Whenever I visit someone’s house, I’m always inspired by their taste, their ideas, their decor. I come home and look at our house with new eyes.

Of course, I can’t, and wouldn’t want to, replicate it all but I repurpose that inspiration to spark ideas of my own.

Obsidian setups come in all shapes and sizes. I like to reuse shared ideas where it works for me and makes sense. But I don’t need to replicate someone else’s Vault, just use what I need.

Obsidian is the home for _your_ notes and thoughts. Make it your own.

Start at the beginning, one step at a time. Allow your setup to evolve organically. Think of it as a work in progress, and enjoy the journey!
