**And lying when he says he doesn’t want his eyesight back!**

Last weekend, [a short film](https://fb.watch/aDJOBHQE98/) made by the BBC about my blind woodturner husband went live. We received lots of positive feedback from friends and complete strangers.

> What an inspiration! Truly motivating. A humbling experience. Inspiring story.

We’re always massively grateful for all the kind words.

But I’m also fascinated by the people who leave negative comments.

> His eyes are moving, focusing on the camera, then jumping to the reporter. This is not how blind people’s eyes usually work.

When Chris is filmed, which is becoming more and more often, the director will click his fingers so that Chris knows which way to face and appears to be looking in the direction of the camera. It’s a simple trick but makes the film more meaningful and real.

#### just a few moments out of a life

A short film doesn’t show what goes on behind the scenes, the direction and conversations. It’s easy to jump to conclusions when all you see is a snapshot.

If Chris is filming his own YouTube videos, he’ll attach a piece of string to the top of the camera and hold the other end to his chin, or his lathe so that he knows he or the lathe are in shot.

> Blind but constantly making eye contact with the camera when talking, when describing he’s using his eyes to look different ways. He’s not 100% blind folks.

Unlike someone who is blind from birth, Chris has learned movements and expressions from 39 years of having sight.

#### my husband doesn’t want his eyesight back

Now, after 13 years of complete sight loss — he sees nothing, no shadows, and is completely and irreversibly blind — he doesn’t want his eyesight back.

Chris is spooky. He notices sounds way before I do. He picks up on everything. He even seems to have a sense of obstacles sometimes. Despite not being able to see anything at all, there’s [another level of awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight).

> Would you like to see again…………”hell no” said no one ever.

It’s a matter of perspective. When you’re sighted and imagine losing your sight tomorrow, yes, of course you would want your sight back in a heartbeat. You can’t imagine life any other way, right now.

> He says he doesn’t want his eyes sight back……Yeah, right!

But, if you’ve been through four years of insomnia, crushing anxiety, fear of going out, hallucinations, and nausea. Then one day, you start to feel better, to adjust to your sight loss and begin to build a new life for yourself.

And start to come out the other side.

Regaining your sight is not as simple as waking up one morning and being able to see again. Quite likely the readjustment process would be a new journey altogether.

> Silly story of course he’d want it back

Imagine if regaining your sight required the same process as losing it, only in reverse. Would you really want to go through that all over again?

#### there are others

We know many other blind and visually impaired woodturners. People who, like Chris, believe in living life on their own terms.

And there are others like Andrea Bocelli who, as well as singing and performing, rides horses.

If you watch Bocelli’s performance from the Duomo in Milan, especially the finale when [we see him walk, unaided, the length of the church](https://youtu.be/bpXwOSHTwsY), through the door and up to a microphone, you’ll notice how he trails his foot on the cable until he arrives at the spot marked out for him.

It’s not magic or fakery. Just many years’ experience, or even a lifetime of learning how to live and function as a blind man.

_Because someone does what you can’t imagine doing doesn’t mean it’s not possible._

Chris is doing things now that he would, most likely, never have done, sighted. He and I certainly wouldn’t have met.

His life is taking him down a completely different path.

If you ask, he will tell you that he believes being a blind woodturner is who he was always meant to be.
