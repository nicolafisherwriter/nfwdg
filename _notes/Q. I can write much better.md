I got out this diary and read, as one does read one's own writing, with a kind of guilty intensity. I confess that the rough and random style of it, often so ungrammatical, often crying for a word altered, afflicted me somewhat. I am trying to tell whichever self it is that reads this hereafter that I can write very much better; \[...\] And now I may add my little compliment to the effect that it has a slapdash and vigour and sometimes hits an unexpected bulls eye. But what is more to the point is my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practice. It loosens the ligaments ~ Virginia Woolf, [A Writer's Diary](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flondonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com%2Ftrack%2Fclick%3Fu%3D8b047263967451488070a8ad0%26id%3D486f81ebc9%26e%3Dd0baf97615&data=04%7C01%7C%7C23fe341523db406d0ca708d9519fbca0%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637630568764429676%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=9WAnfDOB7DuZO8aWZHGRW9XW61uXnOm5eraQAs%2BfrAU%3D&reserved=0 "Protected by Outlook: https://londonwriterssalon.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8b047263967451488070a8ad0&id=486f81ebc9&e=d0baf97615.
