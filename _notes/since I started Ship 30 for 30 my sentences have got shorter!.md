I've just had a look at the first essay I wrote for Ship 30 for 30. What really stands out - the _long_ sentences! Over the last 30 days my writing has evolved. Shorter. Punchier. I had no idea I was doing that. But I take it as a positive.

### I shipped 30 essays

I wrote even when I was tired, and all I wanted to do was skip a day. But I didn't. I used my idea bank in Obsidian to give me a starting point. I published every day. I wanted that unbroken streak.

### I wrote faster

My husband asked the other day, have you written your essay already? Yes! I've speeded up. I honed my workflow. Writing and publishing becomes easier, when you have a plan.

### The key is consistency

My daily publishing habit connected me with others on Twitter, increased my following and engagements. I've been surprised by lovely comments and feedback about my essays.

### Making a Racket

I took to heart the advice to publish in multiple places. My blog, Typeshare, Medium. Did you know you can also squeeze a 250 word essay into a 99 second Racket? Genius!

### What next?

There's still work to be done. Clarifying my niche and the themes I want to explore. Improving my writing. Mostly, continuing to write and ship every day.

### Thinking of signing up for Ship 30 for 30?

I've done a lot of online courses. But this has been outstanding. Dickie and Cole thought of everything, and exceeded all my expectations. Best of all, I've acquired a writing habit, all thanks to their guidance.
