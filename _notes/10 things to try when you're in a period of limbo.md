# 10 things to try when you're in a period of limbo

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">10 things to try when you&#39;re in a period of limbo - our life and work can often be about the ebb and flow.

My life is often famine or feast. 

I can be inundated with work or in a quiet period. These are the principles that I remember when I'm navigating ebbs and flows.

### 1. put your head above the parapet

It's tempting to hibernate (and sometimes that's the answer) but lulls are good times to keep putting your head above the parapet. Be visible, be seen.

### 2. network

Talk and tell your story. You never know who's paying attention.

### 3. if you don't ask, you don't get

Go after what you want. I'm a big believer in Carpe Diem.

### 4. dream big

Now is the time to refer back to your big plan. What can you action right now? What will keep you moving forward?

### 5. start from where you are

I'm a bridge burner and I have to stop myself razing everything to the ground. Instead, I look to see what small step I can take.

### 6. be organised

Having a plan helps massively when you're up against it. This is your life jacket when you're floundering.

### 7. say yes to everything

Spend this time wisely and embrace every opportunity that comes your way. It may be the key to your next thing.

### 8. give it away

Think about how you can help. What can you share right now that might be of service?

### 9. have a good story

Remind yourself of why you started this work in the first place. Write your story and then re-read it when you need inspiration.

### 10. do your own thing

It's easy to look at others and think they're crushing it. Your journey is unique. Follow your own path.

The periods of limbo in our life and work always come to an end. Don't give up. The breakthrough is always just around the corner.
