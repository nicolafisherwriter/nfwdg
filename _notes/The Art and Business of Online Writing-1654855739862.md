## Highlights
it was missing the most important piece of the puzzle: there was no social component, no way for readers to explore and discover new, interesting writers. And without this discovery feature, the likelihood of someone coming across my blog was slim to none. — location: [132](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=132) ^ref-60925

How do you share content where others can read it apart from Medium?

Gamers, on the other hand, know that you have to play Level 1 over and over again in order to reach Level 2. And then you have to play Level 2 over and over again before you can reach Level 3. And if you can just keep on keeping on your journey, learning and mastering each level, you will eventually climb all the way to the top of the ladder. That’s how you “beat the game.” — location: [180](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=180) ^ref-34655

For six months straight, January to June of 2016, I kept up this writing routine—while still working nine hours per day as a copywriter, while commuting an hour on the train to and from work, and while eating five meals per day and hitting the gym for an hour and a half every night. I worked. I lifted. And I wrote. And then every night when I got home from the gym around 9:00 p.m., I’d make myself a plate of gluten-free pasta, asparagus, and chicken, and work on my first memoir, Confessions of a Teenage Gamer, until midnight. — location: [325](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=325) ^ref-6267

Substack is still in Phase 1. In 2019, the platform raised $15.3 million from one of the most well-known venture capital firms in Silicon Valley—Andreesen Horowitz (a16z). This means some very smart people are betting on the growth of the category of “paid newsletters” for writers and media creators. If this category continues to grow, and Substack is the creator of this category, then you better believe the platform is going to grow exponentially over the next five plus years. For this reason, I’ve already moved my own newsletter over to Substack. — location: [1501](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1501) ^ref-34805

How can I effectively use Substack and Ghost?

If your goal is to be a successful writer, then social platforms are for publishing first, and consuming second. I have a rule I live by, and it goes like this: “The number of hours I spend consuming should never equal or exceed the number of hours I spend creating.” — location: [1526](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1526) ^ref-47889

We are afraid of sharing who we are today—because we believe who we’ll be tomorrow will be “better.” This is a vicious cycle. — location: [1550](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1550) ^ref-48362

In order to be taken seriously on the internet as an authority in your category and a leader in your industry, niche, or genre, you need to be writing and publishing new material 2x per month. — location: [1603](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1603) ^ref-18158

All that matters is whether or not we keep spinning the wheel and playing the game. — location: [1630](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1630) ^ref-62810

For example, if you wanted to “beat me” at the game of online writing, and acquire all the achievements I’ve acquired, all you would need to do is: Publish something new every single day (because I publish something new every single day). Write fast-paced articles that use short paragraphs, declarative language, and subheads for every main point. Combine actionable advice for the reader with personal stories from your own life that illustrate how you gained the insight you’re sharing in the first place. Collaborate with professional photographers, build your personal brand, and attach pictures of yourself with the articles you write. Publish more than 3,000 articles online over the next five years. Contribute dozens of articles to Inc Magazine, Forbes, Harvard Business Review, Fortune, Business Insider, The Chicago Tribune, The Huffington Post, TIME, and more, to build your Perceived Credibility. Land a few speaking gigs, and capture pictures of you speaking to illustrate more Perceived Credibility. Speak on 100+ different podcasts, illustrating even more Perceived Credibility. Etc. — location: [1691](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=1691) ^ref-7789

The three types of “content buckets” I recommend are: General Audience: You should have one bucket that is aimed at universal topics. Things like positive habits, life lessons, productivity topics, etc., are big, broad categories that resonate with the widest number of people. How you make them relevant to you is by approaching them through your own specific lens. Let’s say you’re the VP of Marketing at a software company. You should write about life lessons learned as the VP of Marketing at a software company, or time management techniques you use day in and day out as The VP of Marketing at a software company. This same logic applies no matter who you are. You could be a poet, a foodie, or a master salesman, and there is still massive benefit in targeting universal topics through your own specific lens. Niche Audience: Your second content bucket should be hyper-relevant to your expertise. If you’re the VP of Marketing, then your niche audience would be “marketers”—and refined further, maybe “content marketers.” When speaking to this audience, you have the option of continuing to leverage universal topics to broaden your reach, or intentionally excluding general audiences by speaking directly to the intimate pain points your target reader is experiencing. My recommendation is to do both. Company/Industry Audience: Your third content bucket is the environment and industry you exist within. If you’re a violinist, you should be writing about the violin industry. If you’re a music producer, you should be writing about the music production industry. If you own a SaaS business, you should be writing about software as a service and the SaaS industry at large. If you are a writer, you should be writing about writing (in your specific genre). This third bucket is usually the easiest to pinpoint, however it’s an important one to add into the mix in order to be “seen” as a leader in your chosen category. For example, here are my three content buckets: General Audience: Life advice, personal development, and self-mastery as it relates to my own life experiences as a writer and entrepreneur (and previously as a bodybuilder and professional gamer). Niche Audience: Online writing advice, self-publishing, and content marketing. Company/Industry Audience: Thought leadership and personal branding, specifically for executives, founders, investors, etc. Now, it’s important to remember that your content buckets can, and most likely will change over time. When I first started writing on Quora, I experimented with a ton of different Niche Audiences before data told me what people really wanted to hear about from me most. I wrote about gaming, I wrote about bodybuilding, I wrote about big brand advertising campaigns, etc. Eventually, I learned it was really my perspectives on writing and content marketing that attracted the most consistent attention as a “niche,” so I doubled down on that.

“Does this idea fall within one of my three content buckets?” (If not, what can you tweak so that it makes more sense in the context of your library?) “Will this piece stand the test of time?” (If not, what can you change to make it less timely and more timeless?) “Have I already written about this?” (If yes, how can you re-tell those same stories, insights, opinions, etc., in a way that gives the reader a new and different experience?) — location: [3729](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08GZK274F&location=3729) ^ref-44320
