I’ve always had lots of interests. It’s been hard sometimes knowing where to focus. When I was employed I had the luxury of dabbling with my interests in my spare time. It didn’t matter if I wasn’t productive. 

Now my interests drive my work. 

I can feel a bit like a dilettante flitting from one idea to another.
