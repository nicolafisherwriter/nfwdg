Our foray into filming started slowly with some small filming projects for online magazines. Some radio followed and then the local BBC news came to film a short piece about Chris. 

What always interests me is how much footage is required for a short piece of film. 

After that came Sunday Morning Live and the presenter, Samanthi, together with a small team, filmed Chris in the workshop and the house. I had a cameo too! That was two days of filming for less than five minutes of film.

This film introduced us to the idea of saying the same thing several times but from a different camera angle.

One of my favourite films was a solo film maker who spent two days with us and created this. She really got to the heart of what Chris is about, she didn't gloss over the surface but dug deep. We got to know her the best, had a meal together and kept in touch.

The next projects were larger in scale. Casting interviews were involved, including us both. Several Zoom calls to talk about details, what Chris would turn, the format of the filming. We had two days, one at home and one in London when Chris was filmed. This was a bigger crew. The presenter and his co-host. The producer, the sound man, first aid, driver, camera man. 

The biggest project to date was three years in the making. Initial contact came via a casting agency in New York late 2018. 

We've been fortunate enough to have a number of film crews visit us over the past 3 or 4 years. As part of our strategy to share Chris' message of hope, we decided in the early days to _put our heads above the parapet_. This started with some small segments on local news and television channels, which evolved organically into features on various programmes and documentaries, and, most recently, a short film about Chris.

The first few filmings were small affairs. Sometimes just one person turned up with a camera, others with a couple of people. The biggest crew at that point was made up of four. So, when 12 crew descended on us, that was quite a game changer.

I can't tell you a great deal about the film itself. As with pretty much all film projects you're required to sign a NDA (non-disclosure agreement) and are asked not to share any photos or details of filming until the go-live date. The photos I shared on Instagram Stories were extremely generic and anonymised.

We had four transit vans, several cars plus an ambulance in our small cul-de-sac. The neighbours were very kind and forgiving about the parking. In fact, they were pretty excited to have a film crew around too!

And then the kit arrived! Huge camera that was held on a back pack configuration with a frame suspension. Lights. Sound deck. Gazebo. And lenses. I was fascinated by the lenses. £300,000 or so worth. Dating back to the 1970s these lenses were potentially used by the likes of Stanley Kubrick. They were beautiful. Not just to look at but to see the end result on the tiny monitor screens. Even though we've not yet seen the finished film, I've seen snippets of some very mellow filming. About £15,000 each, they were cared for like babies. Wrapped in blankets and handled with reverence.

What surprised me the most was how sad we were to see them leave! Over the 10 days that they were with us, we forged friendships and built connections. We had conversations with all the crew, and hugs, and shed a few tears. It was an intense filming schedule, for us anyway. Perhaps not for them.

They warned us about the PSBs - post-shoot blues. And they came, for me, the next day. I tried to send a Voxer to a friend to say that filming had finished and I couldn't get the words out.

I'm writing part of this post as the film crew is here at our house. I have a set of headphones on so that I can listen to the dialogue from the kitchen as Chris is being filmed in the workshop.

It's been an incredible experience. We first met two of the crew, the Director and Producer. Then another four arrived. I thought that was it. Then, the following day, the rest of the crew arrived making a total of 12 film crew altogether.

What amazed me was how they all gelled and worked together. Despite most of them never having met before, they worked as a team. The corporate world could learn a lot from film crews! The kit they brought was incredible. A huge huge film camera. Lighting. The whole production was being broadcast to the US.

Who was the absolute star of the show? Bamber, of course.

The house was taken over with wires and cables hanging out of windows.

The back garden had a gazebo covering up various pieces of kit, cameras, tech, sound equipment.
