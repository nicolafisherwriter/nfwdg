I'm a planner. Always have been. I like organisation, I love lists and getting things done.

My planning strategy has changed over the years, and continues to evolve. Sometimes it's paper-based, other times it's purely online and techy. I'm always on a quest to find the holy grail of planning. That perfect technique that will make me super productive.

In the meantime, I share what I've learned about a good plan, and the tools and techniques I use every day.
