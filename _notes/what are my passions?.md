I'm compiling this list to remember all the things that fascinate me.

Over the years, one by one, my passions have fallen by the wayside and, gradually, I stopped doing some of the things that were hugely important to me.

## tech

I'm a massive geek. I love tech. I love smart phones. I'm always on a quest for the best app to fulfil a purpose. I love finding cool tools. Until I discovered Obsidian, I'd forgotten how much that floated my boat.

I create my own websites and sites for others. One of the best life skills I acquired was HTML coding. Thanks Malcolm! While I build websites now in WordPress, being able to create, edit and amend code is enormously useful.

## alternative

I'm a Reiki Master Practitioner/Teacher. My Reiki has been on a back burner for a while.

I am fascinated by the esoteric. I have quite a sizeable collection of crystals including a crystal skull.

My Dad and I talked about lots of topics from a young age. I've always believed in UFOs and ETs. 

Over the years my thinking evolved to an understanding that there is a creative energy or force that connects us all. Sometimes I call it the Divine, sometimes Source. Part of the reason I do the work around Essence is because realigning with our Essence is the first step to understanding a bigger picture, whatever that might be for each of us. Connecting to my Essence was the first step in realising my own potential.

## photography

In the past I've been very active as a photographer. I spent all my free time and weekends walking with my camera, often in the huge park near where I lived. I cultivated my skills, had some training and started offering portrait photography sessions and photographed weddings. 

While I became a keen iPhone photographer, especially of street art, I gradually stopped using my DSLR. I've started picking that up recently and pursuing portrait photography again.

## writing

I enjoy writing. I like the physical process of writing with a fountain pen. I love coloured inks and notebooks. I enjoy sitting at my computer, writing. I don't think I'm particularly gifted although I've been told, on occasion, that I'm good with words. (I'm great at proofreading and editing for others).

I've had a few articles published over the years and self-published a book in my thirties.

## gardening

My Dad and I spent a lot of time in the garden when I was little. I had a tiny patch of my own and I remember digging up plants and replanting them. I think they did surprisingly well considering their constant relocation.

I loved pottering and spending time with my Dad. I remember the shed that he had back then and the distinctive smell. The combination of fertiliser, compost, paint, turps and, no doubt, various other chemicals. People would be horrified now but we had a bottle of mercury that I used to decant into different vessels, watching the liquid form globules. 

My Dad loved his garden. We had annuals lining the low front wall, roses in front of the house (I was less keen on the constant deadheading). In the back garden my Dad eventually had a greenhouse where he grew tomatoes, we had sweet peas growing up the side of the shed, a fruit and veg plot with rhubarb, raspberries, strawberries and my tiny little triangular garden.

## outdoors

I craved daylight during all those years when I worked inside offices. Sometimes I would arrive in the dark during Winter and leave in the dark. It felt as though I never saw daylight for five days a week.  

I would race to the park on Saturdays and Sundays at the crack of dawn and spend five hours there, leaving when the masses arrived. It was my sanctuary. It was blissful and it restored me for the week ahead. During the Summer months I would dash home from work so that I could catch some sunlight before the park closed at dusk.

## TE Lawrence

I first came across TE Lawrence when I saw Ralph Fiennes in [A Dangerous Man: Lawrence after Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Dangerous_Man:_Lawrence_After_Arabia). I was completely captivated by this enigmatic and slightly awkward man. I think there were elements of his personality that were reflections of my own. As is my wont, I dived deep into the topic. The public internet was starting to take off and I came across a man in Colorado who shared my interest and we had an email correspondence. He had met TE's brother, Arnold. 

I visited Cloudshill, TE's cottage in Dorset as soon as I could. I went to his grave and the spot where he met with the accident which would lead to his death.

I read everything I could lay my hands on but it was in his letters that I felt a connection. 

The classic film, Lawrence of Arabia, never did it for me though. Too much sand!
