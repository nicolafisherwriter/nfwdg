I've known of [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) for a while but it was when I began using [Obsidian](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/obsidian/) and joined the Discord community that I started reading more about it. [Eleanor Konik](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/), in particular, was sharing her story of using Ghost.

[Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/) has also been part of my inspiration to use Ghost. I've been looking at how others share content and deliver courses and workshops. [Michael Meade](https://www.mosaicvoices.org/) inspired some of my ideas too.

Ghost is a platform that powers the creation of a blog or website. Described as a place for independent publishing, Ghost is similar to the likes of WordPress but has additional built in functionality and open source tools.

### something had to give

I'd been contemplating an alternative way of working for some time. I could no longer fit in everything I wanted to do. Chris and I were spinning umpteen plates, my days were increasingly fragmented as we juggled the demands of the Blind Woodturner business, a spate of filming and maintaining some semblance of domestic life. (Old Mother Hubbard has nothing on us!).

My content creation had become a bit static and I wanted to achieve greater flow. I needed to capitalise on the time I have available and to be able to achieve forward movement. I wanted to find a different way to grow [A Gentler Pace](https://agentlerpace.co.uk/) or risk it quietly retreating on to a back burner.

The other challenge with A Gentler Pace, and one I've faced many times, was that I would back myself into a corner. My niche would become so narrow that I ran out of things to say and introducing some of my other interests at that point seemed at odds with my main theme. A Gentle Life will encompass my many and varied interests. The Essence Map will still be a big theme and I'll be writing about living at a gentle pace, my favourite tech, our garden, my love of stationery and planning. TE Lawrence and the Hero's Journey may also make an appearance.

### going down the membership route

As well as providing the website, Ghost incldues a newsletter and membership function, and it was the membership that I really wanted. I'd looked at some membership plugins for WordPress and, years ago, I used Wishlist but I love to try something new (and shiny).

Eleanor uses the self-hosted version of Ghost and I may well explore that option but, as I'm setting up this website, time is at a premium and I don't want to go down the self-hosting rabbit hole right now.

### the learning curve

So, I'm paying for the self-hosted version. Because I wanted a custom theme, I needed to use [the Creator plan](https://ghost.org/pricing/). In terms of hosting it's not the cheapest but, for comparison, a membership plugin on WordPress comes in at around Â£100+ a year.

There's a little bit of a learning curve if you're not a techie. To update any parts of your theme, you need to first edit the .hbs files in TextEdit and then zip and upload the files to Ghost. The contact form requires some tweaking to make it work.

But I love all this stuff and the end game for me is always to get the tech to do what I want it to do.

### what's the plan?

I'm paring down my ideas for A Gentler Pace. In the early days I had a mad scheme to create an eBook every month, deliver workshops and eCourses. It wasn't remotely doable. The upshot was that I ended up doing less rather than more.

Over the past few months I've realised [how my life has changed](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/evolution/). What I hadn't done was to shift accordingly.

I'll be writing here about [a range of topics](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/writing/) that interest me - and hopefully will interest you too!

I'm going to be starting a podcast that will be available free to subscribers. Some episodes each month will be available as part of the membership option.

Members will be able to access the courses that I launch at a discounted rate.

I'm still figuring out the scope of the membership options - [click here](https://www.agentlelife.co.uk/membership/) for the current details.

### what do I think of Ghost?

The editing screen is reminiscent of Medium. The newsletter function is comparable to Substack. You could achieve much of what Ghost offers in WordPress.

But, to me, Ghost feels _fresh_.

I can create my own ecosystem. Whereas before I was reliant on a third party for my newsletter (MailChimp, Moosend, Substack), my posts and missives are all in one place. I like that.

As I mentioned above, membership was the key driving force for setting up on Ghost. This lets me build a community and share my work in a way I haven't been able to do so far.
