### “I believe the best writing comes from the unconscious. I rarely try to make any decisions consciously or in a cerebral way. It has to be instinctive, and it has to come from the gut. In order to access that, it's very difficult. You can't just sit down and work. You have to be able to tap into it. So, there's a whole process. I exercise a ton. I'm into meditation. There's a certain amount of sleep you have to get. You have to live life almost like an Olympic athlete, because you're trying to summon this kind of muse and spirit that isn't within your conscious control.”
