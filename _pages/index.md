## Welcome! ðŸŒ±

I'm [[Nicola]] and you're reading my published Obsidian notes. Some of these are works in progress, some merely ideas or headlines, others have been published elsewhere. Notes, and my thinking, may be incomplete.

The range of topics reflects my eclectic fascinations from tech, writing, to the esoteric, what I'm [[learning]] and my love of [[gardening]].
